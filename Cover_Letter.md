**Title:** From Months to Minutes: Evaluating an AI-Driven Approach to Systematic Reviews in Plastic Surgery

---

Dear Dr. Chung,

On behalf of my co-authors, I am pleased to resubmit our revised manuscript for *Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery*. We appreciate the thoughtful feedback from the reviewers and have incorporated extensive changes to address every comment.

**Summary of Significance**

Our integrated search-and-screening workflow reduces systematic review screening time from 40–80 hours to minutes while maintaining clinical-grade rigor (≥99% recall with 100% accuracy on eligible studies) and lowering costs by >99% compared with dual-reviewer workflows. The study demonstrates how plastic surgery–specific criteria, when encoded by experts and executed by AI, enable reliable, reproducible evidence synthesis across microsurgery, reconstructive, aesthetic, and outcomes research topics.

**Major Revisions in Response to Reviewers**
- Introduced plastic surgery–specific rationale and explicit study questions; clarified that the study validates the screening phase while outlining future work on data extraction and quality assessment.
- Added detailed prompt examples, full configuration workflows, and complete screening YAML files (Supplementary Tables S1–S2; supplementary_data/screening_configs) to make the approach reproducible.
- Expanded outcome explanations for clinical readers (sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV) and added statistical methods with 95% CIs; streamlined Results to highlight key findings.
- Detailed replication of each original literature search (database, dates, Boolean strings) and released full screening code, validation results, and analysis script for reproducibility.
- Provided a new comparison with ASReview, RobotReviewer, and Rayyan; analyzed error sources, bias, and the human-in-the-loop role of AI, emphasizing that AI augments rather than replaces expert judgment.
- Addressed multilingual capacity, IP/ethics considerations, transparency about LLM versions/parameters/costs (Supplementary Table S3), and prompt development time (2–4 hours per review); discussed living-review capability and monthly update cycles.
- Reorganized tables/figures per reviewer guidance (consolidated overlap; added redesigned workflow figure) and ensured all revisions are marked in red text in the manuscript per journal instructions.
