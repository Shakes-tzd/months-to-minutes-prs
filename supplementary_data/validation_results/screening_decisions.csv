While the abstract only mentions 'successful replantations,' it does not explicitly state that failures were excluded from the study, and the sample size threshold (≥5) is met. Quantitative outcome data are implied by the comparison of results. The anatomical level is described as 'very distal finger amputations,' which likely includes the DIP joint or more distal, but this should be confirmed at full-text review. There is no evidence of exclusion criteria being violated. Ambiguity about whether failures were excluded and the exact anatomical level means this should advance to full-text review."
