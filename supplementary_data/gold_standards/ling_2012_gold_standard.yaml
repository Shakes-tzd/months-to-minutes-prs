  abstract: 'BACKGROUND: A variety of free flaps have been successfully used for mandible
    reconstruction. This study compared the short- and long-term results of using
    the free iliac crest and fibula flaps. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis
    of 117 patients who underwent mandibular reconstruction, 59 patients with iliac
    crest and 58 with free fibula. Accurate long-term functional assessment was possible
    in 31 cases in the iliac crest group and in 48 patients with fibular reconstruction.
    Anterior or combined anterolateral defects formed 72% and 64% in the iliac crest
    and fibula groups, respectively. The remainder were pure lateral defects. In both
    series, a skin paddle was included to provide either lining, skin cover, or both
    in 77% of the cases, whereas in 23% bone only was used. RESULTS: Complications
    included two perioperative deaths and three flap losses in the iliac crest group
    and five flap losses in the fibula group. Long-term functional and cosmetic assessment
    showed no statistically significant differences in oral continence (p > 0.9),
    speech (p = 0.57), and contour results (p = 0.80) between the two groups. However,
    oral deglutition was statistically significantly better in the fibula free flap
    group (p = 0.009). CONCLUSION: Although the fibula free flap is the flap of choice,
    the iliac crest is an excellent and reliable complementary flap for mandibular
    reconstruction.'

  abstract: A retrospective analysis of 100 consecutive patients undergoing free fibula
    harvest at the Mayo Clinic is presented. Every patient was analyzed by reviewing
    postoperative physical examination data. All patients were evaluated and followed
    in the early postoperative course by the physical medicine and rehabilitation
    services. Patients were followed from 3 to 60 months, with an average follow up
    of 17.42 months. In the patient group, 72 flaps were osseous and 28 osteocutaneous.
    Thirty-six complications at the donor site were observed in 30 patients. An additional
    19 patients required prolonged pharmacologic pain control beyond the first 6 postoperative
    weeks, with no donor-site complications clinically detectable. Hammertoe was observed
    in six patients and wound dehiscence in seven patients. Tendon exposure was observed
    in five patients; partial split-thickness skin graft loss was observed in eight.
    Numbness of the foot was reported in 10 patients. Fifteen patient had limited
    maximum ambulatory distance to less than 1000 m. An additional six patients reported
    difficulty walking stairs. Attention to details and meticulous wound care are
    required to further reduce wound-healing complications. Immediate postoperative
    involvement of the physical medicine and rehabilitation services was beneficial
    in early patient mobilization and achievement of preoperative ambulation levels.
    After a short rehabilitation period, the majority of patients were able to engage
    in all daily activities.

  abstract: 'OBJECTIVES: To (1) compare the complications and functional outcome of
    primary closure vs split-thickness skin grafting of the fibula osteocutaneous
    flap donor site, (2) identify patient-mix or treatment factors related to donor
    site complications, and (3) address early detection and management of donor site
    complications. DESIGN: Retrospective review and questionnaire study. SETTING:
    Two university tertiary referral centers. PATIENTS: Fifty-three patients (31 men
    and 22 women, ages 20 to 80 years) who underwent fibula osteocutaneous free tissue
    transfer between February 1992 and January 1997. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Minor
    complications; major complications; and postoperative function, including sensory
    and motor deficits, pain, swelling, temperature intolerance, and activities of
    daily living. RESULTS: Four patients developed major wound complications (group
    1), 11 patients developed minor wound complications (group 2), and 38 patients
    had no wound complications (group 3). The donor site was closed primarily in 26
    patients and with a split-thickness skin graft in the remaining 27 patients. Major
    wound complications developed in 3 patients (12%) who underwent primary closure
    and 1 patient (4%) who underwent split-thickness skin grafting. Minor wound complications
    developed in 7 (27%) of the patients who underwent primary closure and 4 patients
    (15%) who underwent split-thickness skin grafting. Three patients who had major
    complications had residual sensory or motor deficits that resulted in impaired
    gait or alteration in their daily activities. Comparing all patients with complications
    (groups 1 and 2) to patients with no complications (group 3) demonstrated an increased
    incidence of donor site complications in heavy smokers (P<.05) and a strong trend
    toward higher donor site complications in patients who underwent primary closure
    (P =.10). Although trends were identified, no significant differences were found
    in age, comorbid illnesses, alcohol use, preoperative laboratory values, operating
    time, tourniquet time, or skin paddle width. CONCLUSIONS: A variety of patient-mix
    and operative factors are likely related to the development of donor site wound
    complications. Width of the skin paddle alone is not a reliable criterion for
    determining the need to skin graft the donor site. Primary closure tended to result
    in a higher rate of both major and minor wound complications compared with split-thickness
    skin grafting. Primary closure of fibula donor site defects should be undertaken
    if this can be accomplished with no tension along the suture line. If tension
    at the suture line is present, a skin graft should be strongly considered to minimize
    the possibility of a wound complication. Arch Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg. 2000;126:1467-1472'

  abstract: 'PURPOSE: Mandibular reconstruction represents a challenge to the oral
    and maxillofacial surgeon and has been revolutionized by the modern microvascular
    techniques. Rehabilitation using techniques such as reconstruction plates frequently
    produce a functional and cosmetic defect. The primary objective of the current
    study was to evaluate the usefulness of the osteomuscular free fibular flap for
    this purpose. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The results of 26 vascularized free fibula
    flaps with or without a skin paddle that were used for mandibular reconstruction
    is presented. The "double barrel" technique was used in 6 cases. The donor site
    was closed directly in 2 cases and with an abdominal full-thickness skin graft
    in 24 cases. RESULTS: All flaps except 1 were viable. There was partial necrosis
    of the skin island in 1 patient. The average length of the fibula graft was 10.96
    cm, and the number of osteotomies ranged from 0 to 3. In the donor site, the most
    significant problem was unsatisfactory scarring related to the use of a skin graft.
    There were no long-term functional complications in the lower leg. Two patients
    have been secondarily rehabilitated with osseointegrated implants. CONCLUSION:
    The fibula flap provides a successful bone graft for mandibular restoration with
    an acceptably low complication rate. This method meets most of the requirements
    for oral and mandibular replacement.'

  abstract: The free microvascular fibula and soft tissue transfer has become a widely
    used method to reconstruct the head and neck region. Only few reports focus on
    the donor site morbidity of purely mandibular reconstructions. On the basis of
    the hospital charts, a standardized patient interview and a standardized physical
    examination, the present study evaluates the early and late donor site morbidity
    in 42 mostly oncologic patients after an average follow-up interval of 34 months.
    Of these, 16 patients (38.1%) exhibited complicated wound healing that did not
    correlate with the patient's age, sex, type of transplant, use of a skin graft,
    result of preoperative angiography, rate of postoperative mobilization or the
    incidence of late donor site morbidity. At the time of follow-up examination,
    about one-fourth of the patients reported discomfort, pain or swelling. Objective
    findings included sensory deficits in 76.3%, motor deficits in 39.5% and reduced
    strength in 44.7% of the patients. Even though objectively measured morbidity
    exceeded subjectively perceived morbidity, it can be concluded that there is significant
    early and late donor site morbidity, which should be considered when opting for
    a fibula graft. Patients should be informed accordingly.

  abstract: Despite the popularity of the donor region 'laterodorsal calf' with the
    fibula, the flexor muscles and the overlying skin for microsurgical bone and soft
    tissue transfer some limitations and possible pitfalls have to be considered.
    We report on 93 patients who had 96 reconstructions, 65 with and 31 without soft
    tissue transfer in 8 years using microvascular fibular grafts for mandibular replacement
    and oromandibular reconstruction. Six patients died within 4 weeks and eight flaps
    were lost. Necrosis of the skin paddle occurred in 7 (11%) of 61 cases with uncomplicated
    bony healing.

  abstract: Since 1993, a total of 41 free osteofasciocutaneous fibular flaps with
    an extended skin island (average dimensions, 16.9 cm long [range, 12-22 cm] x
    10.7 cm wide [range, -16 cm], or 180.8 cm [range, 112-352 cm ]) have been used
    in by the authors in various clinical applications. To evaluate donor site morbidity,
    the 41 patients involved were asked to answer a questionnaire and to present themselves
    for clinical and radiological examination. The subjective findings reported by
    these patients, and the examinations, showed that donor site morbidity was moderate.
    Apart from some occurrence of mild edema and pain, as well as modest motor weakness
    of the great toe, and deficiency of distal nervous segments, only 7 patients were
    found to have a slightly positive anterior drawer of the talus (anterior subluxation
    of the talus), but no instability. In conclusion, donor site morbidity after harvest
    of osteofasciocutaneous fibular flaps for different clinical indications, where
    extended skin islands were needed, is moderate.

  abstract: The purpose of this study was to determine the subjective and quantitative
    donor-site morbidity after removal of a free vascularized fibula flap for autoreconstruction.
    Ten patients and six age-matched, healthy control subjects were included in this
    study. The postoperative periods ranged from 6 to 87 months. Subjective donor-site
    morbidity was assessed with a patient questionnaire and the Enneking system. For
    quantification of donor-site morbidity, gait was evaluated during normal walking,
    walking under visual and cognitive constraints, and walking at a velocity higher
    than the preferred one. In general, the patient perception of donor-site morbidity
    was low. Complaints were frequently mentioned, however, including pain (60 percent),
    dysesthesia (50 percent), a feeling of ankle instability (30 percent), and inability
    to run (20 percent). Gait analyses revealed that patients walked at a lower preferred
    velocity, compared with control subjects. Furthermore, they demonstrated significant
    increases in the coefficients of variation of stride time during walking under
    visual and cognitive loads and during walking at a velocity higher than the preferred
    one, compared with normal walking. These increases were not observed for control
    subjects. These findings suggest that the reautomatization of gait is affected
    among patients. This study demonstrates that fibula harvesting is associated with
    low subjective morbidity but frequent complaints. Walking during complex tasks
    and at high velocities reveals that restoration of gait is not complete after
    partial fibulectomy.

  abstract: The amount of muscle that should be retained on the free fibula during
    harvest is unresolved. Muscle is used to protect the periosteum, but by harvesting
    a large muscle cuff, the recipient and donor site morbidity increases. A retrospective
    review of 47 free fibula flaps performed between January 1997 and March 2002 was
    undertaken. There was an average follow-up of 15 months. The dissection method
    used for all cases was a muscle sparing technique where the peroneal vessels were
    skeletonised anteromedially. Only a very thin rim of muscle (1-2 mm) was left
    attached to the fibula. The recipient and donor vessels were flushed with heparin
    saline solution intra-operatively and a Dextran 40 infusion was used for four
    days post-operatively in all cases. Of the 47 flaps, 39 were used for mandible
    reconstruction, six for maxillary reconstruction and two for long bone reconstruction
    following trauma. The average age was 47.7 years (range 13-82) and two-thirds
    (28/43) of the patients were male. There was one post-operative death. The overall
    failure rate was 10.9% (5/46). Two flaps were lost as a result of arterial thrombosis,
    one from venous thrombosis, one from sepsis and in one case the cause could not
    be determined. There were 2 (4.3%) recipient site haematomas. It is suggested
    that the low recipient site haematoma rate in this series may be related to the
    limited muscle bulk transferred with the flap. Harvesting less muscle also enables
    easier insetting and folding of skin flap, and reduces the donor site problems
    of haematoma and weakness of the foot. The blood supply to the fibula does not
    appear to be compromised.

  abstract: Composite free tissue transfer has an established role in head and neck
    oncology for the reconstruction of the bony defect following tumor ablation, and
    while donor-site morbidity is variably reported, there is little consensus on
    the most favorable donor site. The fibula and deep circumflex iliac artery have
    distinct advantages in terms of the volume and length of bone in mandibular reconstruction.
    Few studies have compared their donor-site morbidity. The aim of this study was
    to compare the fibula and deep circumflex iliac artery flaps using a review of
    the case notes and cross-sectional review of patients attending a research clinic
    for validated orthopedic examination and completion of health-related quality-of-life
    questionnaires. Between February of 1993 and May of 2001, 44 fibula free flaps
    and 73 deep circumflex iliac artery free flaps were performed. Ninety-nine case
    notes and 36 patients were available for review of donor-site morbidity. Sixteen
    patients with fibula flaps and 20 patients with deep circumflex iliac artery flaps
    took part in the clinical examination component of the study, which was composed
    of a clinical examination by an orthopedic surgeon using the American Orthopedic
    Foot and Ankle Society ankle scoring system and the Harris hip scoring system,
    and two patient-completed questionnaires, the University of Washington Questionnaire
    and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Subjective and objective markers
    of morbidity related to both flaps were similar in most parameters. However, fibula
    flaps were associated with more problems with donor-site healing, reduced power,
    and sensation. Poor orthopedic scores for both flaps were associated with notably
    poor scores on the University of Washington Questionnaire and the Hospital Anxiety
    and Depression Scale. The study would suggest that both deep circumflex iliac
    artery and fibula donor sites result in an acceptable and comparable morbidity
    for most patients, but in cases in which significant donor-site morbidity is encountered,
    health-related quality of life is significantly compromised.

  abstract: 'The authors reviewed retrospectively the clinical results of 51 consecutive
    cases of vascularized osteocutaneous fibular graft to the tibia for the reconstruction
    of extensive tibial bone and soft-tissue defects. The mean duration of follow-up
    was 31 months (range: 13 to 76 months). In the 51 procedures of free vascularized
    osteocutaneous fibula graft from the contralateral side, bony union was achieved
    in 48 cases at an average of 3.74 months after the operation, except for two cases
    of non-union and two cases of delayed union. Forty-eight cutaneous flaps survived,
    and three cutaneous flaps failed due to deep infection and venous thrombosis.
    All united fibulae hypertrophied during the follow-up periods. Stress fracture
    of the grafted fibula was the most common complication (16 cases), and it was
    treated with above-the-knee cast immobilization or internal fixation with a conventional
    cancellous bone graft. The free vascularized osteocutaneous fibular graft is recommended
    as a useful treatment modality for the reconstruction of extensive tibial defects
    combined with soft tissue injury.'

    space. Only 1 patient had increased talar tilt compared with the contralateral
    side, although this patient had preservation of stability. CONCLUSION: Fibula

  abstract: The aim of this study was the quantitative assessment of donor-site morbidity
    after fibula harvest. Ten patients were identified with a unilateral fibula harvesting
    and healthy contralateral side. The average follow-up time was 32.3 months. The
    study design included standardized questionnaire; morbidity point-evaluation system;
    orthopedic-biomechanical evaluation, including true ankle motion, clinical-functional
    American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) hindfoot score, pedobarography,
    measurement of maximal voluntary isometric strength, and radiologic examination
    using an ankle osteoarthritis grading. Average donor-side morbidity score was
    low, with 2.6 points (range, 0 to 13). Average AOFAS hindfoot score was good,
    with 87.3 points (range, 74 to 100). Pedobarography showed significant decrease
    of the big toe pushup force. Isometric strength measurement showed significant
    reduction of the peroneus longus muscle. Discrete to mild medial ankle osteoarthritis
    was found in 70% of the cases. The overall donor-side morbidity was low, but an
    eversion torque deficit could initiate or support a progressive functional ankle
    instability and in long-term cause or accelerate a ligamentous secondary ankle
    osteoarthritis.

  abstract: 'OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: The purpose of this report is to describe our
    recent experience using a double-skin paddle fibular free flap (DSPFFF) for reconstruction
    of the through-and-through anterior mandibulectomy defect and to present a reconstructive
    algorithm based on the extent of lip and mental skin resection. STUDY DESIGN:
    Retrospective review of 10 consecutive patients with through-and-through anterior
    mandibulectomy defects. METHODS: Outcomes that were examined included methods
    of reconstruction based on the cutaneous defect, flap complications, fistula rate,
    and donor site complications. RESULTS: Seven patients were reconstructed with
    a DSPFFF. For lip reconstruction, two patients were also concomitantly reconstructed
    with Karapandzic or lip advancement flaps. Three patients were reconstructed with
    both a fibular free flap and a second free flap (1 radial forearm fasciocutaneous
    flap and 2 anterolateral thigh flaps). The transverse dimensions of the DSPFFFs
    were as great as 15 cm. None of the patients developed a fistula. All free tissue
    transfers were successful. One patient developed partial loss of the fibular skin
    paddle used for submental skin replacement. CONCLUSIONS: DSPFFF is a safe and
    reliable way to reconstruct an anterior through-and-through mandibular defect.
    Indications for using a DSPFFF are 1) a cutaneous defect that lies at or below
    the plane of the reconstructed mandible, 2) a transverse width of the oral mucosa
    and cutaneous defect that does not exceed 15 cm (the approximate distance from
    the mid-calf to the anterior midline), and 3) a lip defect that, if present, can
    be reconstructed with local flaps.'

    of 20 patients was assessed at the Laboratory for Biomechanics, Seoul National
    University Hospital. Kinematic and kinetic data were collected simultaneously
    while walking on a 25-m walkway. One month postoperatively, a significant (p<0.05)
    decrease in the time-distance parameter as well as a significant (p<0.05) decrease
    in the peak plantarflexion and dynamic range was seen. Only peak plantarflexion
    in swing was significantly (p<0.05) decreased until 3 months postoperatively.
    On the basis of the gait analysis results, it was concluded that normalization
    of the patients' gaits would be expected within 3 months after the operation.
    There were no permanent pathological changes in the donor site.

  abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Although vascularized bone grafts have become well accepted
    in adults, especially following ablative head and neck procedures, there are few
    long-term reports of their use in pediatric patients. METHODS: In this study,
    the authors analyzed the outcomes of 18 free fibula grafts in 16 patients aged
    10 months to 21 years (mean, 12 years) with an average follow-up of 5 years. Eleven
    patients had cancer-related defects, four had craniofacial anomalies, and one
    had a posttraumatic deformity. All patients with congenital malformations had
    been followed since birth, and the others had been followed from the time of their
    original cancer diagnosis or injury. RESULTS: Of the 16 patients, seven underwent
    irradiation and seven underwent chemotherapy. The most severe deformities were
    seen in those with cancer resection and radiation therapy. Most defects were hemimandibular;
    there was one total mandibular defect (a child with Ewing sarcoma). Ten patients
    had had previous failed nonvascularized bone grafts. Eleven flaps were osteocutaneous
    with either intraoral or extraoral components; most had multisegmental osteotomy
    and had one arterial and two venous anastomoses. All free fibula transfers were
    successful; there were no vascular problems and only two minor complications.
    CONCLUSION: A number of lessons are learned from careful analysis of this unique
    group of patients, and an algorithm of pediatric mandibular reconstruction is
    proposed.'

  abstract: 'OBJECTIVE: Since the advent of modern microvascular techniques, the fibula
    has become a reliable method for the reconstruction of partial or total mandibular
    defects. The purpose of this study is to evaluate our experience with the use
    of the vascularized free fibular flap for the reconstruction of mandibular defects
    following surgical resection. PATIENTS AND METHODS: During a 5-year period, 102
    consecutive patients were treated in our department for reconstruction of oral
    and maxillofacial defects, using microvascularized free flaps. Forty-two patients
    were reconstructed by means of the free vascularized fibular flap with or without
    a skin paddle. Patients underwent resection for benign (n = 15) and malignant
    (n = 27) entities. Fourteen patients received preoperative radiotherapy and only
    1 patient received preoperative chemotherapy. The donor site was closed primarily
    in 7 cases, whereas an abdominal full-thickness skin graft was used in 35 cases.
    RESULTS: Thirty-eight patients were treated by means of an osteocutaneous flap,
    whereas only 4 developed an osseous flap. Five patients developed complications
    related to the vascular anastomosis and needed a second surgical look. One patient
    died in the immediate postoperative period. The skin island flap was completely
    viable in 37 cases (88%). Considering bone survival as the main objective, an
    overall flap survival rate of 92.85% was achieved in the whole series. Endosseous
    dental implants were placed in 11 patients with adequate outcome. In 5 of these
    cases the double-barrel technique was performed. CONCLUSION: Our results reveal
    that the vascularized free fibular flap is a reliable method for reconstructing
    mandibular defects with an acceptable low morbidity rate. The use of the osteocutaneous
    flap provides good reconstruction of composite mandibular defects. It constitutes
    an adequate support for dental implants.'

  abstract: The aim of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of the free osteofasciocutaneous
    fibular flap in mandible reconstruction in 23 patients. We reviewed their clinical
    records and asked the subjects to answer a questionnaire, as well as to attend
    our hospital for a clinical and radiological examination. The mean follow up was
    1.3 years. In 15 patients, the flap was used for contemporaneous intraoral mucosal
    and extraoral cutaneous reconstruction. In seven cases, bilateral mandibular reconstruction
    was performed. Skin paddle edge necrosis was observed in seven flaps postoperatively,
    however, no total flap loss resulted. No additional soft-tissue flap was needed
    since the fibular flap harvested held an extended skin paddle reaching up to 352
    cm(2). The donor-site morbidity was moderate and furthermore most of the patients
    were satisfied with their functional and aesthetic result. The free osteofasciocutaneous
    fibular flap is the best possible therapy for the demanding reconstruction of
    the mandible. The fibular bony part is a safe foundation for the placement of
    osseointegrated implants which further improves the patient's quality of life.

    flap harvest, a case-control study in a hospital-based biomechanical laboratory
    was conducted. Eleven patients receiving fibula osteoseptocutaneous flaps were

    The average postoperative period at the time of evaluation was 27.4 months (range:
    10 to 68 months) and the average age at the time of evaluation was 52.1 years

    were used for objective assessment of the donor leg function postoperatively.
    No statistical differences were observed in the kinetic and kinematic variables
    of gait analysis except double support time in both the groups. There were also
    no significant differences in simple static balance test (eyes open, eyes closed,
    swaying vision, eyes open with swaying surface, and sway-referenced vision and
    support). Significant differences were observed in more difficult task (eye closed
    with swaying support) and in the use of ankle strategy for maintaining maximum
    balance. In the dynamic balance test only specificity of the forward left direction
    determined significant difference in reaction time of movement control of gravity.
    The results of ankle strategy usage and dynamic balance indicated deficits of
    ankle muscle torque. Necessary postoperative physical training is required for
    ankle muscle torque and vestibular sense.'

    flaps has been previously evaluated and is considered minimal. The purpose of
    this study was to investigate functional deficits after bilateral fibular osteoseptocutaneous
    flap harvest. Between 1990 and 2004, 7 consecutive patients undergoing mandible
    reconstruction utilizing bilateral autogenous free fibular osteoseptocutaneous

    symptoms on the donor leg: pain, paresthesia, walking ability, restriction in

    gait analysis were used to quantitatively assess functional outcomes. The results
    of this objective assessment were compared with those of 8 age-matched control
    subjects. Most patients had few subjective symptoms. The most common complaints
    were pain after prolonged walking (14%), slight difficulty in squatting (28%),
    and minimal paresthesia on 1 of the donor legs (14%). There were no significant
    differences in reaction time and movement velocity on either the balance test
    or gait analysis between the study and control groups (P > 0.05). However, there
    were significant differences with regard to right backward directional control,
    maximum stability with eye closing, sway referenced support, and ankle strategy

  abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Previous studies highlight the risk of valgus ankle instability
    in children following vascularized fibular procedures. We have observed that persistent
    valgus instability results in valgus deformity in these ankles. The aim of this
    study was to explore the risk factors associated with valgus ankle deformity following
    vascularized fibular graft harvest. METHODS: We present 31 patients with minimum
    follow-up of 2 years and maximum of 18 years. They underwent regular clinical
    evaluation of their ankles and routine radiological evaluation when valgus deformity
    became clinically apparent. RESULTS: Five patients developed valgus ankle deformities.
    Risk factors for development of valgus deformity included age under 14 years (P
    = 0.02) and short [6 +/- standard deviation (SD) 1 cm] residual fibular lengths
    (P = 0.02). Age-residual fibula index (age in years plus residual distal fibula
    length in centimeters) under 16 strongly predicted the development of ankle deformity
    (P = 0.0008). Short residual fibular lengths were not consistently associated
    with valgus deformity. Children developed focal lateral tibial epiphyseal atrophy
    and premature antero-medial fusion of the distal fibular physis resulting in a
    concave-anterior bowing of the fibula. Skeletally mature patients had congruent
    joints and posterior rotation of the proximal fibula without bowing. CONCLUSIONS:
    Mechanical causes cannot solely explain valgus ankle deformity following vascularized
    fibula harvest. Secondary changes due to growth arrest in the ankle significantly
    contribute to this deformity.'

  abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Autogenous vascularized fibular transfer is used effectively
    for a variety of complex reconstructive procedures. Published series demonstrating
    the morbidity associated with its harvest have, understandably, been relatively
    small, and graft site (hip) complications have not been reported. This report
    describes both the donor and the graft site morbidity associated with use of vascularized
    fibular transfer to treat osteonecrosis of the femoral head. METHODS: Between
    1990 and 2006, 1270 free vascularized fibular grafts were used to treat osteonecrosis
    of the femoral head in 946 consecutive patients. All procedures and follow-up
    examinations were performed by one of two surgeons. Subjective and objective findings
    were recorded on standardized examination sheets at routine postoperative intervals.
    Data were analyzed to determine the morbidity associated with donor and graft
    sites. RESULTS: There were 215 complications (a 16.9% rate) at the time of follow-up,
    at an average of 8.3 years, after the 1270 procedures. Of these complications,
    146 (11.5%) and sixty-nine (5.4%) were referable to the donor and graft sites,
    respectively. A major complication requiring an additional surgical procedure
    or chronic pain management occurred after fifty-four (4.3%) of the 1270 procedures.
    CONCLUSIONS: A measurable but acceptable morbidity risk is associated with vascularized
    fibular transfer for the treatment of osteonecrosis of the hip. Major complications
    are not frequent, and many minor complications are transient and improve over
    time. Risks can be minimized when specific technical principles are followed.'

  abstract: 'OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to analyze complications following
    fibular free flap (FFF) transfer for mandibular reconstruction using our definition
    of postoperative complications. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective observational study.
    PATIENTS AND METHODS: This retrospective study presents our 4-year experiences
    with FFF for mandibular reconstruction by a single microsurgical team. Data were
    collected through patient record review and clinical evaluation by 2 independent
    assessors. We defined complications as any unwanted postoperative outcomes that
    compromised patient care. Early complication occurred within the first 2 weeks
    postoperatively; late complications occurred afterward. RESULTS: Of 25 patients
    included, 13 patients (56%) experienced complications. Early and late complications
    occurred in 13 and 9 patients, respectively. These included flap loss, malunion,
    skin-paddle necrosis, orocutaneous fistula, wound dehiscence, hematoma, soft tissue
    contracture, intraoral hair growth, facial asymmetry, osteoradionecrosis, donor-site
    morbidity, and medical complications. Revision surgeries were performed in 10
    patients, ranging from wound dressing to flap removal. All but 2 flaps survived,
    yielding an overall success rate of 92%. Most of the patients were alive without
    disease (92%) at the end of the study. Average follow-up was 47.2 months (range:
    26-77). CONCLUSION: Despite the small number of patients, these preliminary data
    suggest a relatively high frequency of complications following the FFF reconstruction
    based on our definition. Minor complications are common and should not be neglected
    because they may lead to devastating consequences. This should also be a part
    of informed consent for patients. Complications after the FFF transfer await keen
    evaluation to establish guidelines to improve end results.'

  abstract: 'Our aim was to evaluate the long-term morbidity at the donor site after
    harvest of free fibular flaps. From a total of 165 patients, we were able to examine
    (not randomly) 62 donor regions in 57 patients (33 men and 24 women) 2-167 months
    (mean 45 months) after fibular transfer. Patients'' individual risk factors and
    any disturbances of healing, and dysfunction of the toes, were recorded. The Kitaoka
    ankle-hindfoot score was used for evaluation of functional impairment. Thirteen
    donor regions displayed prolonged wound healing, eight of which needed revision
    of the wounds. Eight (14%) had abnormalities of gait. The median Kitaoka ankle-hindfoot
    score was 93 (range: 14-100). In 17 patients (27%) after a follow-up period of
    4 months, hammer and claw toes and deficits in dorsal extension of the hallux
    were assessed. Thirty patients (48%) had sensory deficits of the calf and toes.
    Neither the risk factors recorded nor the factors that indicated disturbance of
    wound healing or deformities of the toe were significantly associated with the
    development of functional impairment. In more than three-quarters of the cases
    healing was uneventful, but in a small number the morbidity at the donor site
    was severe, forcing the patient to use walking aids. We were not able to identify

  abstract: Lower gingival squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) frequently invades the mandibular
    bone and buccal or lingual oral mucosa. In the concept of en bloc surgery of malignant
    tumors, it is advisable to prefer segmental mandibulectomy for T3-T4 lower gingival
    carcinoma that had radiologic bone involvement and resection of soft tissue on
    the buccal or lingual side with negative border of margin. Consequential defects
    of oral mucosa and mandible need immediate reconstruction to provide the maximum
    probability of cure and quality of life with minimal donor site morbidity. The
    aim of this study was to evaluate the fibula osteocutaneous flap with skin island
    as a means to meet both hard and soft tissue reconstructions needed in a one-stage
    procedure of gingival SCC. Data of 17 patients, with gingival SCC pathologically
    and who underwent en bloc operations including segmental mandibulectomy and reconstruction
    of mandible and intraoral mucosa with fibular flap, were retrospectively analyzed.
    The segmental mandibular defects ranged from 8 to 17 cm, and intraoral soft tissue
    defects ranged from 4 degrees at 2.5 cm to 8.5 degrees at 4 cm. The flaps survived
    in all 17 patients including 9 patients who received postoperative radiotherapy
    with good final function of the lower leg. Of 17 patients, 11 had with no evidence
    of disease with a mean follow-up period of 25 months. Our study results, together
    with literature findings, revealed that the fibula that had a long length of good-quality
    bone and sufficient blood supply were suitable for stable osteosynthesis, with
    the overlying skin suitable in thickness and without limitation of skin flap size
    for intraoral reconstruction especially after ablative surgery. This method provides
    oral and maxillofacial surgeons with a means to meet both hard and soft tissue
    needs in a one-stage procedure for extensive resection of gingival SCC.

  abstract: In some cases, the fibula osteocutaneous flap may not provide sufficient
    soft tissue for obliterating dead space after tumor ablation. This report describes
    a modified fibula osteocutaneous flap using a portion of soleus muscle to reduce
    postoperative complications. This study analyzed 20 patients who underwent ablative
    oral cancer surgery with mandibular segmental defect between September 2005 and
    June 2007. Of total, 17 cases were mandible complex defects and 3 were composite
    defects. Of total, 18 were men and 2 were women, respectively. Age range was 30
    to 74 years, and mean age was 53 years. The procedure entailed harvest of chimeric
    fibula flap with skin paddle and bone segment composed of a sheet of soleus muscle
    (7 x 4 to 12 x 5 cm in size) originating from the perforator branch of the peroneal
    artery. The soleus muscle was used to obliterate the dead space of the mouth floor
    and cheek-neck area. All flaps survived except 1 failure due to venous insufficiency.
    The submandibular and chin area exhibited mild swelling at the submandibular area
    early postoperatively. Patients had achieved satisfactory contour without donor
    site morbidity at a mean 12-months of follow-up. Complications included 2 flaps
    requiring reoperation due to the flap pedicle compromised. One flap was successfully
    salvaged but the other failed. Two cases of orocutaneous fistula-induced infection
    recovered after conservative treatment. Donor site assessment revealed a satisfactory
    outcome without major donor site morbidity. This refinement in mandibular reconstructive
    surgery substantially reduces postoperative complications.

  abstract: 'PURPOSE: This report documents our experience over the previous 15 years
    using free vascularized fibular flaps for comprehensive reconstruction of large
    defects in the mandible, after combined resections of aggressive, malignant odontogenic
    tumors or for post-traumatic defects. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Charts were reviewed
    retrospectively for 117 consecutive patients who underwent microsurgical reconstruction
    of the oromandibular complex with a fibula osteocutaneous or osteomyocutaneous
    free flap over a 15-year period, with an average follow-up of 4 years. All charts
    were reviewed retrospectively for tumor type, stage and location, surgical procedure
    performed (including type of plate used), dental restoration if done, the use
    of pre- or postoperative radiotherapy, length of follow-up, and evidence of complications.
    RESULTS: Fibula osteocutaneous free flaps were used for reconstruction in 117
    patients, of whom 60% were men (mean age, 57.1 years) and 40% were women (mean
    age, 56.6 years). Most cases (61.1%) were secondary to oral malignancies (89.1%
    of these were squamous cell carcinoma). Thirty-one patients (26.5%) developed
    postoperative complications, including hardware failure or intolerance in 16 patients
    (13.7%), total or partial flap failure in 10 patients (8.5%), wound infection
    in 3 patients (2.6%), and peroneal nerve damage in 2 patients (1.7%). Regarding
    donor site morbidity, calf paresthesias were recorded in 21% of cases. Similar
    rates of claw-toe deformity were also observed. CONCLUSIONS: In our opinion, the
    free fibula osteocutaneous flap is the most versatile and reliable option for
    microsurgical reconstruction of large mandibular defects. It provides a large
    quantity of bone, which is easily shaped to passively adapt to the remaining mandible.
    The bone height is suitable for an implant-based prosthetic restoration. Preoperative
    mapping of the cutaneous perforators of the skin paddle improves the versatility
    of the flap design and decreases the morbidity at the donor site. In selected
    cases, other options (iliac crest or scapular free flap) may also be considered.'

  abstract: 'Raising the osteocutaneous fibular flap offers excellent possibilities
    for oral reconstructive surgery but is associated with specific donor-site risks.
    Moreover, with inadequate surgical technique, flap-specific complications can
    occur, such as loss of the skin paddle or inadequate pedicle length. A flap-raising
    technique has been used to decrease surgical damage but provide maximal pedicle
    length. Sixty-six osteocutaneous fibular flaps were raised by the lateral approach
    with the following modifications: 1) flap-raising was carried out without a tourniquet,
    2) only the amount of bone needed was removed, leaving the rest of the fibula
    intact, 3) only a minimal muscle cuff was included, and 4) the complete pedicle
    was dissected along the posterior intermuscular septum without opening the interosseous
    membrane and without touching the deep flexor muscles proximal to the osteotomized
    fibular segment. The skin paddle was placed distally in the leg, perfused by only
    1 perforator in most cases. Medical records were analyzed and patients were examined
    postoperatively for up to 32 months to evaluate the above-mentioned complications.
    Of the 66 reconstructions, 44 were performed in a previously operated or irradiated
    neck. Three flaps and 1 skin paddle were lost. The most common donor-site complications
    were temporary wound-healing disturbances of the skin graft (n = 17) and transient
    pain or sensory alterations (n = 12). No compartment syndrome, ankle instability,
    or need for walking aids was recorded. A hammertoe deformity developed in 1 patient.
    On average, pedicle length was 9 cm and flap-raising took 130 minutes. In conclusion,
    maximal pedicle length and minimal bone and muscle resections can be achieved
    with a small number of donor-site complications. The skin paddle is highly reliable
    based on only 1 perforator. Perforators can be precisely controlled when raising
    the flap in the perfused leg.'

  abstract: Ten adults were studied two to seven years after resection of a fibula
    for use as a free vascularised bone graft. Six had no symptoms in the donor leg,
    four had some aching, weakness or paraesthesia and three had definite weakness
    of the long toe flexors and extensors. All knees and ankles were clinically and
    radiologically stable, but the distal fibular remnant was osteoporotic in nine
    patients. Gait analysis of the donor leg and the contralateral normal leg showed
    definite differences, which could be attributed to weakness of the deep muscles
    caused by loss of their normal origin and to the change in load transmission through
    the fibula.

  abstract: The fibula was investigated as a donor site for free-flap mandible reconstruction.
    It has the advantages of consistent shape, ample length, distant location to allow
    a two-team approach, and low donor-site morbidity. It can be raised with a skin
    island for composite-tissue reconstruction. Twelve segmental mandibular defects
    (average 13.5 cm) were reconstructed following resection for tumor, most commonly
    epidermoid carcinoma. Five defects consisted of bone alone, and four others had
    only a small amount of associated intraoral soft-tissue loss. Eleven patients
    underwent primary reconstructions. At least two osteotomies were performed on
    each graft, and miniplates were used for fixation in 11 patients. Six patients
    received postoperative radiation, and two patients received postoperative chemotherapy.
    The flaps survived in all patients. All osteotomies healed primarily. The septocutaneous
    blood supply was generally not adequate to support a skin island for intraoral
    soft-tissue replacement. The aesthetic result of the reconstruction was excellent
    in most patients, particularly in "bone only" defects. There was no long-term
    donor-site morbidity.

  abstract: Eleven patients with free vascularized fibula graft transplants to the
    upper extremity were studied for donor-side morbidity effects. Based on their
    surgical follow-up times, the patients were divided into either group 1 (5 +/-
    2 months) or group 2 (21 +/- 8 months) to examine the effects of surgical trauma
    more closely. Gait evaluation was performed using two walkways containing different
    ground conditions. Knee and ankle-foot motion was measured using a three-dimensional
    electrogoniometer. Basic temporodistance factors and ground reactions were obtained
    from foot switches, instrumented floor mats, and a force plate. A modified Cybex
    II isokinetic dynamometer was used to quantitate ankle-foot strengths. Moderate
    knee and ankle-foot motion changes were seen while walking on the level, sideslope,
    and ramp in patients evaluated less than 10 months after their surgical procedure.
    Minimal joint motion effects were discovered in patients with follow-up times
    longer than 10 months. Muscle strengths were significantly impaired in both groups,
    especially foot inversion and eversion. An inverse relationship existed between
    the length of resected fibula and ankle evertor muscle strength. Donor side morbidity
    does not appear to be caused by surgical soft-tissue trauma exclusively. These
    patients need to be studied for several more years to determine the long-term
    functional effects of free vascularized fibular graft transfer.

  abstract: One hundred and ninety-eight consecutive patients (247 vascularized fibular
    grafts) were studied to determine the prevalence of morbidity at the donor site
    after the grafts had been obtained. Objective motor weakness, subjective discomfort
    in the ankle and other sites in the leg, and sensory abnormalities in the lower
    limb (or limbs) from which the graft had been obtained were recorded. The average
    duration of follow-up was forty-seven months (range, twenty-four to 144 months).
    Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to estimate the prevalence of each finding for
    the entire cohort over time. Forty-seven (19.0 per cent) of the 247 lower limbs
    had at least one of the findings, and eighteen(24.3 percent) of the seventy-four
    limbs for which data were available at five years or more had findings at that
    time. Twenty-five (10.1 per cent) of the 247 limbs had evidence of motor weakness
    at three months postoperatively, although no limb had this finding subsequently.
    At five years or more postoperatively, the prevalence had decreased to two (2.7
    per cent) of the seventy-four limbs. Twelve (4.9 per cent) of the 247 limbs had
    sensory deficits at three months; this increased to 11.8 per cent (95 per cent
    confidence interval, 7.7 to 17.7 per cent), according to the Kaplan-Meier analysis,
    at five years. Pain at sites other than the ankle was noted in nine (3.6 per cent)
    of the 247 limbs at three months and in 8.9 per cent (95 per cent confidence interval,
    5.5 to 14.1 per cent), according to the Kaplan-Meier analysis, at five years.
    The prevalence of pain in the ankle also increased with time, from four (1.6 per
    cent) of the 247 limbs at three months to 11.5 per cent (95 per cent confidence
    interval, 7.4 to 17.6 per cent), according to the Kaplan-Meier analysis, at five
    years. Removal of a vascularized portion of the fibula is associated with a low
    prevalence of motor weakness and sensory deficits in the foot. The prevalence
    of pain in the ankle and lower limb increases with time, with some patients having
    a late onset of the symptoms. While free vascularized fibular grafts remain ideal
    for many applications, the morbidity must be weighed against the benefits.

    reconstruction with a fibula free flap in a retrospective study of 29 cases, and
    make comparisons with the iliac free flap and the lateral brachial free flap.
    MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty-nine patients (22 male, 7 female) aged 5 to 70 years
    were studied. Functional and esthetic evaluations were performed together with
    radiologic examination of the bony calluses. RESULTS: The fibula free flap has
    advantages for mandibular reconstruction, such as the length of bone available,
    low morbidity of the donor site, and the possibility of using a skin paddle. However,
    there is the disadvantage of not being able to reconstruct large soft tissue defects.
    In addition, bone vascularization is reduced when a large number of osteotomies
    are required. CONCLUSION: This reconstruction technique is satisfactory for mandibular
    defects measuring over 20 cm.'

  abstract: Over a period of 3 years, 50 consecutive free fibular flaps for mandibular
    reconstruction were performed on 47 patients. In 38 patients (81%) a skin paddle
    was included with the flap to provide either mucosal lining or skin cover; in
    9 patients (19%) bone alone was used. Thirty-one patients (66%) required a skin
    graft to close the donor defect in the leg. Donor leg morbidity and function were
    determined by patient questionnaire and by physical examination. Forty-one donor
    sites in 40 patients were available for long-term follow-up. The follow-up ranged
    from 4 to 39 months with an average of 17 months. Immediate postoperative infection
    occurred in the donor site of 1 patient (2%) and required additional surgery.
    There was no other immediate donor site complications when closure required skin
    grafting. Eleven patients (27%) had late donor site morbidity, consisting of motor
    weakness of the great toe in 5 patients, ankle instability and/or stiffness in
    3 patients, donor site pain in 1 patient, and edema in 2 patients. All complications
    were graded as mild in severity by the patient and by the examiner. In this series,
    although most donor site defects required skin grafting, short- and long-term
    morbidity was minimal. After a short rehabilitation period, all patients were
    fully able to engage in all daily and recreational activities.

  abstract: 'OBJECTIVE: To review the experience of 1 microvascular surgeon during
    an 11-year period in performing 210 vascularized bone-containing free flaps for
    oromandibular reconstruction. DESIGN: Retrospective medical records review of
    patients who underwent primary and secondary oromandibular reconstruction with
    the use of vascularized bone free flaps. SETTING: Academic medical center. PATIENTS:
    A total of 201 patients underwent 210 composite free-flap reconstructions of the
    mandible for various disorders and with a range of bony and soft tissue defects.
    INTERVENTION: All patients underwent the microvascular transfer of vascularized
    bone flaps from the ilium, fibula, or scapula. In selected cases, 2 simultaneous
    free flaps were transferred to achieve an optimal bone and soft tissue reconstruction.
    Endosteal dental implants were used in 81 patients, with a total of 360 fixtures
    placed during these 11 years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The success of microvascular
    free tissue transfer, dental implant extrusion, and short- and long-term complications
    at the recipient and donor sites. RESULTS: Of the 210 mandibular reconstructions
    that were performed, 202 were successful in reestablishing mandibular continuity.
    Reexploration for vascular-related complications was done in 16 patients, 8 of
    whom were successfully treated, yielding an overall success rate of 96%. The overall
    success rate for endosteal dental implants was 92%. The implant success rate was
    86% when the bone in which the fixtures were placed was irradiated postoperatively.
    The success rate was 64% in the 14 fixtures that were placed into previously irradiated
    bone. CONCLUSIONS: The success of the use of vascularized bone free flaps in restoring
    continuity to the mandible is clearly demonstrated in this series. There was an
    acceptable incidence of donor- and recipient-site complications that resulted
    in minimal long-term morbidity. The careful selection of a donor site(s) for oromandibular
    reconstruction allows for an optimal restoration of bony and soft tissue defects.
    Dental implants can be safely used in oromandibular reconstruction with a high
    level of success. Placing these implants during the initial surgery shortens the
    duration for achieving dental rehabilitation and enhances the success of the implants
    when postoperative radiotherapy is administered.'

  abstract: We examined donor site morbidity in thirty-nine patients with avascular
    necrosis of the femoral head treated by curettage and transplantation of a free
    ipsilateral fibular graft. Utilising our donor site morbidity questionnaire, scar,
    functional loss, wound healing, complications, and pain were analysed. Subjective
    complaints and objective findings were evaluated and compared. Subjective complaints
    were common and included a sense of instability in 42% and a sense of weakness
    in 37%. However, objective findings were limited. No clinical instability could
    be elicited and only great toe flexion (29%) and extension (43%) were found to
    be mildly weak. Only one patient required reoperation for a donor site problem
    (2%). Eighty-nine percent were pain free at time of follow-up, and 93% felt the
    scar was good. Range of motion of the knee and ankle of the donor site leg was
    not different from the nonoperated leg. Donor site morbidity for avascular necrosis
    of the femoral head is low.
