  abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Lipoinjection is a promising treatment but has some problems,
    such as unpredictability and a low rate of graft survival due to partial necrosis.
    METHODS: To overcome the problems with lipoinjection, the authors developed a
    novel strategy known as cell-assisted lipotransfer (CAL). In CAL, autologous adipose-derived
    stem (stromal) cells (ASCs) are used in combination with lipoinjection. A stromal
    vascular fraction (SVF) containing ASCs is freshly isolated from half of the aspirated
    fat and recombined with the other half. This process converts relatively ASC-poor
    aspirated fat to ASC-rich fat. This report presents the findings for 40 patients
    who underwent CAL for cosmetic breast augmentation. RESULTS: Final breast volume
    showed augmentation by 100 to 200 ml after a mean fat amount of 270 ml was injected.
    Postoperative atrophy of injected fat was minimal and did not change substantially
    after 2 months. Cyst formation or microcalcification was detected in four patients.
    Almost all the patients were satisfied with the soft and natural-appearing augmentation.
    CONCLUSIONS: The preliminary results suggest that CAL is effective and safe for
    soft tissue augmentation and superior to conventional lipoinjection. Additional
    study is necessary to evaluate the efficacy of this technique further.'

  abstract: Breast enhancement with artificial implants is one of the most frequently
    performed cosmetic surgeries but is associated with various complications, such
    as capsular contracture, that lead to implant removal or replacement at a relatively
    high rate. For replacement, we used transplantation of progenitor-supplemented
    adipose tissue (cell-assisted lipotransfer; CAL) in 15 patients. The stromal vascular
    fraction containing adipose tissue progenitor cells obtained from liposuction
    aspirates was used to enrich for progenitor cells in the graft. Overall, clinical
    results were very satisfactory, and no major abnormalities were seen on magnetic
    resonance imaging or mammogram after 12 months. Postoperative atrophy of injected
    fat was minimal and did not change substantially after 2 months. Surviving fat
    volume at 12 months was 155 +/- 50 mL (Right; mean +/- SD) and 143 +/- 80 mL (Left)
    following lipoinjection from an initial mean of 264 mL. These preliminary results
    suggest that CAL is a suitable methodology for the replacement of breast implants.

  abstract: Autologous fat grafting for breast augmentation has faced some historical
    hurdles. However, in recent years it has been gaining acceptance from the medical
    community. This prospective, nonrandomized open-label study of 20 Japanese women
    supports the use of autologous fat grafting in breast augmentation and explores
    enhancement of fat graft tissue with autologous adipose-derived regenerative cells
    (ADRCs). After adipose harvesting using syringe liposuction, the tissue is processed
    in the Celution 800 System((R)), which washes the graft and isolates ADRCs. The
    average cells per gram of harvested adipose tissue was 3.42 x 10(5), and the mean
    cell viability measured using an automated cell counting system before graft delivery
    was 85.3%. All patients demonstrated improvement in circumferential breast measurement
    (BRM) from their baseline state, and breast measurements were stable by 3 months
    after surgery. The mean BRM 9 months after surgery had increased 3.3 cm from preoperative
    measurements. Through 9 months, overall physician satisfaction was 69% and patient
    satisfaction was 75%. No serious or unexpected adverse events were reported, and
    the procedure was safe and well tolerated in all patients. Postoperative cyst
    formation was seen in two patients. These prospective results demonstrate that
    ADRC-enriched fat grafts processed with a closed automated system maintain high
    cell viability and that the procedure is safe and effective, with all patients
    showing improvement after a single treatment.

  abstract: 'AIMS: Women undergoing breast conservation therapy (BCT) for breast cancer
    are often left with contour defects and few acceptable reconstructive options.
    RESTORE-2 is the first prospective clinical trial using autologous adipose-derived
    regenerative cell (ADRC)-enriched fat grafting for reconstruction of such defects.
    This single-arm, prospective, multi-center clinical trial enrolled 71 patients
    post-BCT with defects </=150 mL. METHODS: Adipose tissue was collected via syringe
    lipoharvest and then processed during the same surgical procedure using a closed
    automated system that isolates ADRCs and prepares an ADRC-enriched fat graft for
    immediate re-implantation. ADRC-enriched fat graft injections were performed in
    a fan-shaped pattern to prevent pooling of the injected fat. Overall procedure
    times were less than 4 h. The RESTORE-2 protocol allowed for up to two treatment
    sessions and 24 patients elected to undergo a second procedure following the six
    month follow-up visit. RESULTS: Of the 67 patients treated, 50 reported satisfaction
    with treatment results through 12 months. Using the same metric, investigators
    reported satisfaction with 57 out of 67 patients. Independent radiographic core
    laboratory assessment reported improvement in the breast contour of 54 out of
    65 patients based on blinded assessment of MRI sequence. There were no serious
    adverse events associated with the ADRC-enriched fat graft injection procedure.
    There were no reported local cancer recurrences. Injection site cysts were reported
    as adverse events in ten patients. CONCLUSION: This prospective trial demonstrates
    the safety and efficacy of the treatment of BCT defects utilizing ADRC-enriched
    fat grafts.'

  abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Stem cell enrichment is generally believed to be of crucial
    importance for success in lipofilling for cosmetic breast augmentation. No comparative
    clinical studies have been reported to support this. METHODS: A total of 18 women
    underwent breast augmentation with water-assisted lipotransfer (WAL). In 10 of
    the cases, transferred lipoaspirate was enriched with stromal stem cells using
    the Celution((R)) system (Cytori Therapeutics Inc., San Diego, Ca, USA). Magnetic
    resonance imaging (MRI)-based volumetric analysis was done preoperatively and
    6 months after the procedure. To verify scientifically that stem cells were transplanted,
    samples of the transplanted tissues were processed in the laboratory to isolate
    the adipose stem cells (ASCs). RESULTS: MRI volumetry revealed a volume survival
    of the whole (watery) graft of mean 54% (SD 7) in the WAL only and of 50% (SD
    10) in the WAL with stem cell-enrichment patients. As centrifugation of the WAL
    grafts demonstrated an average adipose tissue of 68%, the average volume survival
    of adipose tissue itself was 79% (SD 13) in the WAL only and 74% (SD 14) in the
    WAL with stem cell-enrichment patients. This difference (4.5%) was not statistically
    significant (independent samples t test, p = 0.330, 95% confidence interval of
    difference, 4.8, 13.9%). CONCLUSIONS: Breast augmentation by lipofilling using
    WAL alone is faster, cheaper, has a lower risk of contamination and offers at
    least an equal take rate. We do not see any advantage in stem cell enrichment
    by the Celution((R)) system in cosmetic fat transplantation to the breast.'

  abstract: Cell-assisted lipotransfer (CAL) is a cotransplantation of adipose tissue
    and stromal vascular fraction (SVF) including adipose-derived stem cells. But
    although CAL can get satisfactory outcomes in breast augmentation, the resorption
    of the grafted fat is still unclear. A total of 12 patients received breast augmentation
    using CAL. All of them completed 6 months of follow-up. In 1 mini-CAL case, 500-mL
    liposuction fluid was used to harvest the SVF cells. In 11 full-CAL cases, 250-mL
    aspirated fat was needed apart from 500-mL liposuction fluid. The percentage of
    adipose-derived stem cells in SVF cells was detected using flow cytometry and
    their multilineage potential ability was assessed with in vitro induction. The
    volumes of breasts and pectoral muscle were measured, and radiological image change
    was analyzed using magnetic resonance imaging before the operation and 3 and 6
    months after the operation. Additionally, the subjective evaluation on the cosmetic
    outcomes was determined by surgeons and patients. Adipose-derived stem cells in
    SVF cells accounted for 40.27% and 3.34% in full-CAL cases and mini-CAL cases,
    respectively. Postoperative atrophy occurred within the first 3 months. At the
    6 months postoperatively, breast volume is augmented, ranging from 60.71 to 197
    mL, with a mean value of 125.35 (45.49) mL. The ultimate resorption of grafted
    fat at the 6 months postoperatively is 51.84% (16.74%). Newly formed cysts and
    nodules were detected in 2 cases. No calcification was found in all magnetic resonance
    images. Only 1 patient was unsatisfied with the cosmetic outcome. Our preliminary
    study displayed a satisfactory augmented volume with little complications using
    CAL for breast augmentation. But the resorption at the 6 months postoperatively
    [51.84% (16.74%)] showed no significant advantage over non-CAL technique (40%-60%
    reported), which suggested that SVF cells harvested from 250-mL aspirated fat
    and 500-mL liposuction fluid were insufficient to average 250-mL grafted fat for
    each breast in this study. More SVF cells are needed to achieve lower resorption.

  abstract: 'INTRODUCTION: Autologous fat grafting is commonly used to correct soft-tissue
    contour deformities. However, results are impaired by a variable and unpredictable
    resorption rate. Autologous adipose-derived stromal cells in combination with
    lipoinjection (cell-assisted lipotransfer) seem to favor a long-term persistence
    of fat grafts, thus fostering the development of devices to be used in the operating
    room at the point of care, to isolate the stromal vascular fraction (SVF) and
    produce SVF-enhanced fat grafts with safe and standardized protocols. Focusing
    on patients undergoing breast reconstruction by lipostructure, we analyzed a standard
    technique, a modification of the Coleman''s procedure, and three different commercially
    available devices (Lipokit, Cytori, Fastem), in terms of 1) ability to enrich
    fat grafts in stem cells and 2) clinical outcome at 6 and 12 months. METHODS:
    To evaluate the ability to enrich stem cells, we compared, for each patient (n=20),
    the standard lipoaspirate with the respective stem cell-enriched one, analyzing
    yield, immunophenotype and colony-forming capacity of the SVF cells as well as
    immunophenotype, clonogenicity and multipotency of the obtained adipose stem cells
    (ASCs). Regarding the clinical outcome, we compared, by ultrasonography imaging,
    changes at 6 and 12 months in the subcutaneous thickness of patients treated with
    stem-cell enriched (n=14) and standard lipoaspirates (n=16). RESULTS: Both methods
    relying on the enzymatic isolation of primitive cells led to significant increase
    in the frequency, in the fat grafts, of SVF cells as well as of clonogenic and
    multipotent ASCs, while the enrichment was less prominent for the device based
    on the mechanical isolation of the SVF. From a clinical point of view, patients
    treated with SVF-enhanced fat grafts demonstrated, at six months, a significant
    superior gain of thickness of both the central and superior-medial quadrants with
    respect to patients treated with standard lipotransfer. In the median-median quadrant
    the effect was still persistent at 12 months, confirming an advantage of lipotransfer
    technique in enriching improving long-term fat grafts. CONCLUSIONS: This comparative
    study, based on reproducible biological and clinical parameters and endpoints,
    showed an advantage of lipotransfer technique in enriching fat grafts in stem
    cells and in favoring, clinically, long-term fat grafts.'

  abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Actually, there are 2 main methods to obtain stromal vascular
    fraction (SVF): enzymatic digestion and mechanical filtration; however, the available
    systems report heterogeneous and sometimes not univocal results. The aim of this
    study is to evaluate different procedures for SVF isolation and compare their
    clinical efficacy in the treatment of soft-tissue defects in plastic and reconstructive
    surgery. The authors evaluated Celution and Medikhan, enzymatic systems, and Fatstem
    and Mystem system, mechanical separation systems. METHODS: Fifty patients affected
    by breast soft-tissue defects were treated in the Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery
    Department of Tor Vergata University of Rome. Four groups of 10 patients were
    managed with enhanced SVF fat grafts using cells obtained by Celution (Cytori
    Therapeutics, Inc., San Diego, Calif.), Medikhan (Medi-Khan Inc., West Hollywood,
    Calif.), Fatstem (Fatstem CORIOS Soc. Coop, San Giuliano Milanese, Italy), and
    Mystem (Mystem evo Bi-Medica, Treviolo, Italy) systems. A control group of 10
    patients was treated with only centrifuged fat according to Coleman''s technique.
    RESULTS: In enhanced SVF-treated patients treated with cells obtained by Celution
    system, we observed a 63% +/- 6.2% maintenance of contour restoring after 1 year,
    compared with 39% +/- 4.4% of control group. In patients treated with SVF obtained
    by Medikhan system, we observed a 39% +/- 3.5% maintenance, whereas enhanced SVF
    with Fatstem and Mystem systems gave a 52% +/- 4.6% and 43% +/- 3.8% maintenance
    of contour restoring, respectively. SVF cell counting indicated that Celution
    and Fatstem were the most efficient systems to obtain SVF cells. CONCLUSIONS:
    Celution and Fatstem were the 2 best automatic systems to obtain SVF and to improve
    maintenance of fat volume and prevent the reabsorption.'

  abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Breast augmentation by cell-assisted lipotransfer (CAL) may
    achieve a more natural breast contour than silicone implants. Moreover, certain
    complications associated with these prosthetic devices can be avoided with CAL.
    Few prospective studies of CAL have been performed to examine long-term volume
    changes, effects on breast parenchymal tissue, and the effect of stromal vascular
    fraction (SVF) on graft survival. OBJECTIVES: In a 1-year prospective study of
    patients who underwent CAL, the authors examined changes in breast volume, effects
    on parenchymal tissue, and the impact of SVF on graft survival. METHODS: Following
    preoperative radiologic examination, patients underwent primary augmentation mammaplasty
    by CAL to both breasts. The SVF was characterized, and changes in breast volume
    were determined from magnetic resonance imaging studies performed postoperatively
    at 3 months and 1 year. A breast-imaging specialist reviewed all scans to detect
    changes in breasts. RESULTS: Five patients (10 breasts) were enrolled. Averagely
    23% of grafted fat in volume was additionally harvested from each patient to isolate
    SVF cells. One year after CAL, breast volume had decreased to 47% of the initial
    postoperative volume. There was no parenchymal changes except small oil cysts.
    The ratio of SVF cell count to grafted fat volume showed no correlation with graft
    survival. Patterns of breast-volume decrease differed between older women with
    a history of breastfeeding and younger women without a history of breastfeeding.
    CONCLUSIONS: The addition of SVF cells did not appear to improve the retention
    of grafted fat in these patients. Skin tension may be an important factor influencing
    the absorption pattern of grafted fat. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE 4: Therapeutic.'

  abstract: 'Lipoaspirated fat grafts are used to reconstruct volume defects in breast
    surgery. Although intraoperative treatment decisions are influenced by volume
    changes observed immediately after grafting, clinical effect and patient satisfaction
    are dependent on volume retention over time. The study objectives were to determine
    how immediate breast volume changes correlate to implanted graft volumes, to understand
    long-term adipose graft volume changes, and to study the "dose" effect of adding
    autologous stromal vascular fraction (SVF) cells to fat grafts on long-term volume
    retention. METHODS: A total of 74 patients underwent 77 cell-enhanced fat grafting
    procedures to restore breast volume deficits associated with cosmetic and reconstructive
    indications. Although all procedures used standardized fat grafts, 21 of the fat
    grafts were enriched with a low dose of SVF cells and 56 were enriched with a
    high SVF cell dose. Three-dimensional imaging was used to quantify volume retention
    over time. RESULTS: For each milliliter of injected fat graft, immediate changes
    in breast volume were shown to be lower than the actual volume implanted for all
    methods and clinical indications treated. Long-term breast volume changes stabilize
    by 90-120 days after grafting. Final volume retention in the long-term was higher
    with high cell-enhanced fat grafts. CONCLUSIONS: Intraoperative immediate breast
    volume changes do not correspond with implanted fat graft volumes. In the early
    postoperative period (7-21 days), breast volume increases more than the implanted
    volume and then rapidly decreases in the subsequent 30-60 days. High-dose cell-enhanced
    fat grafts decrease early postsurgical breast edema and significantly improve
    long-term volume retention.'
