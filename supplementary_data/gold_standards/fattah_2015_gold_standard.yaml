  abstract: 'OBJECTIVE: The senior authors developed a computer-assisted rapid, simultaneous
    comparison system for nine international grading scales for facial paralysis.
    The purpose of this study is to present the system and to compare the agreement
    of hand-performed House-Brackmann and Sunnybrook scales, two frequently used scales
    herein taken as the concurrent criterion test standards, with those like scales
    done simultaneously in the computed system. STUDY DESIGN: The study design was
    a prospective concurrent criterion validity study. Test-retest reliability and
    interobserver agreement were assessed using the kappa statistic (k) for ordinal
    data and the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) for semidimensional data.
    SETTING: The study was conducted at a university practice. PATIENTS: Ten consecutive
    consenting subjects with varying degrees of facial paralysis were studied. INTERVENTION:
    Each subject was measured, in random order, twice by each method by each of two
    independent observers. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: House-Brackmann score, Sunnybrook
    score, and like-scale scores done simultaneously in the computed system were measured.
    RESULTS: Agreement between the computed system and hand-performed criterion standards
    was equal to each scale compared against itself; for the House-Brackmann, agreement
    was moderate (k = 0.554); for the Sunnybrook, agreement was excellent (ICC = 0.976).
    CONCLUSIONS: The computed system has the advantage of allowing an examiner to
    view a rapid, simultaneous display of multiple grading scale scores at a keystroke
    from one clinical assessment input, obviating the labor of repeating measures
    by hand.'

  abstract: The Toronto Facial Grading System (TFGS) is an observer scale for rating
    facial nerve dysfunction. The TFGS scores aspects of resting symmetry, symmetry
    of voluntary movement, and synkinesis for each division of the face (subscores)
    and then provides calculated total scores and an overall composite score of facial
    function. The developers of the scale have validated its sensitivity for identifying
    small changes in facial dysfunction and the independence of the different components
    measured. Herein we report our results in a study of interobserver reliability
    using the TFGS. Twenty-five patients from the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary
    Facial Nerve Center with varying degrees of facial paresis, paralysis, and synkinesis
    were videotaped, and the video recordings were scored by 5 independent observers
    using the TFGS. Intraclass correlation coefficients (kappa) and 95% confidence
    intervals were calculated for subscores and for each total and composite score.
    Intraclass correlation coefficients ranged from 0.59 to 0.85, all considered substantial
    to near-perfect agreement between observers. We believe the TFGS is superior to
    other scales by virtue of its sensitivity, comprehensiveness, ease of use, and
    interobserver reliability. The TFGS presently appears to be the best option in
    those situations in which accurate and precise documentation of facial function
    is required.

  abstract: A comparison between the House-Brackmann facial nerve grading system (the
    HB-system) and the Yanagihara grading system (the Y-system) was studied with 199
    evaluations of 62 cases of postoperative unilateral acoustic neuroma. In the beginning,
    an original draft of the conversion table was formulated according to the 199
    evaluations, in which, 0-6, 8-14, 16-20, 22-28, 30-38, and 40 points in the Y-system
    were matched with grade VI, V, IV, III, II, and I in the HB-system respectively.
    The result of the present study for prediction of sequelae showed that it was
    not necessary to consider the sequelae in a conversion table. And more, the study
    of an inter-observer variation showed that the lower and upper limits of the scores
    in the Y-system may shift within about a 2-point range in the draft table. From
    these aspects, a newly revised conversion table was proposed as a revised conversion
    table, in which, 0-6, 8-14, 16-22, 24-30, 32-38, and 40 points in the Y-system
    were matched with grade VI, V, IV, III, II, and I in the HB-system. This revised
    conversion table is much easier to remember for clinical use, because the score
    of the lower limit of each grade is simply in multiples of 8, that is, 0, 8, 16,
    24, 32 and 40.

  abstract: 'OBJECTIVE: To develop and validate a patient-based instrument to measure
    both facial impairment and disability, the Facial Clinimetric Evaluation (FaCE)
    Scale. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective instrument validation. METHODS: Eighty-six patients
    with a documented history of facial paralysis completed a preliminary, 51-item
    instrument (alpha FaCE Scale), as well as the previously developed Facial Disability
    Index (FDI) and the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form 36 Item Questionnaire (SF-36).
    Two weeks after completing these instruments, 76 patients again completed the
    alpha FaCE Scale. Forty-one of the patients were also evaluated using the House-Brackmann
    Grading System (HBGS) and the Facial Grading System (FGS). RESULTS: Exploratory
    principal component factor analysis grouped 15 FaCE Scale items into 6 impairment
    and disability categories (domains), forming the beta FaCE Scale. Overall, the
    test-retest reliability of the FaCE Scale was high (Spearman''s correlation coefficient
    (r) = 0.88, P <.01), as were the reliability coefficients of the individual domains
    (r = 0.81-0.92, P <.01). The FaCE Scale domains showed appropriate correlation
    to global visual analogue scale questions posed on the original alpha FaCE Scale
    (r = 0.65-0.81, P <.01). Overall, the FaCE Scale showed significant correlation
    with HBGS and FGS scores (r = -0.55 and 0.57, respectively; P <.01). However,
    not all FaCE Scale domains correlated with the HBGS and FGS scores. CONCLUSIONS:
    A reliable and valid patient-based system to measure impairment and disability
    in facial paralysis has been developed. This system appears to be better than
    traditional, physician-graded scales for evaluating quality-of-life issues affected
    by facial disability.'

    interval study using one measurement instrument. SETTING: Tertiary teaching hospital
    (Sunnybrook & Women''s College Health Science Centre). METHODS: Twenty-two patients
    with a wide spectrum of facial dysfunction recorded on videotapes were rated using
    the SFGS by eight novice observers independently in two different sittings separated
    by 3 weeks. The order of patients was randomized for the second sitting. Intraclass

    within and between raters. RESULTS: The intrarater reliability coefficients for
    the eight raters ranged from .838 to .929. This largely overlaps with the data
    obtained in previous studies with expert raters. The inter-rater reliability for
    all eight raters at time 1 was .982 and for time 2 was .970. This is higher than
    what was previously obtained with expert raters. CONCLUSION: The SFGS is as reliable
    when applied by novice users as by expert users.'

  abstract: 'OBJECTIVE: To determine the clinical significance of the House-Brackmann
    facial nerve grading scale (HBFNGS) in the setting of differential function along
    the branches of the facial nerve. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective study of 38 patients
    with facial palsy who demonstrated differential facial function. SETTING: Tertiary
    referral center. PATIENTS: Patients with facial nerve dysfunction from any cause.
    Patients with complete facial nerve paralysis (House-Brackmann Grade 6) were excluded.
    INTERVENTION: Physicians were provided with printed description of the HBFNGS
    and asked to report facial nerve function as a traditional global score and as
    a regional score based on the House-Brackmann scale for the forehead, eye, nose,
    and mouth. This was reported as F(w) E(x) N(y) M(z), where w, x, y, and z ranged
    from 1 to 6 based on the HBFNGS. Synkinesis was graded as none, mild, or severe.
    MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The traditional HBFNGS score was compared with a regional
    grading facial nerve grading system based on the HBFNGS for the forehead, eye,
    nose, and mouth. Agreement between the traditional global score and the regional
    scores was analyzed. RESULTS: In patients with variable facial weakness, the single
    House-Brackmann score did not fully communicate their facial function. Further,
    the single grade did not always correlate with the best or worst function along
    the four facial regions. The single House-Brackmann score most strongly correlated
    with the regional scoring of the eye (61%), followed by the nose/midface (40%),
    mouth (32%), and forehead (18%). The global score did not correlate with the worst
    regional score in 30 patients (79%). In 3 of 5 patients with synkinesis and an
    obligatory Grade 3 or higher in the global House-Brackmann grading system, the
    regional facial function was Grade 2 or better at one or more areas of the face.
    CONCLUSIONS: In patients with differential facial function, a single global number
    is inadequate to describe facial function and primarily reflects the function
    of the eye. Regional assessment using the HBFNGS and reported as F(w) E(x) N(y)
    M(z) more fully communicates facial function.'

  abstract: There have been several attempts at establishing a grading system to estimate
    the severity of a facial palsy. This study compares the validity and consistency
    of all the leading systems. The results indicate that the systems are comparable
    and overall none had the advantage over the others. Interobserver variation had
    a significant effect on the consistency of the systems used, but experience of
    the observer was not a significant factor. The simplest classification studied
    was the House-Brackman system which is recommended.

  abstract: 'OBJECTIVE: To assess the agreement between the Sunnybrook facial nerve
    grading system and the House-Brackmann and Yanagihara systems. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective
    clinical facial nerve grading. SETTING: Tertiary referral center. PATIENTS: One-hundred
    assessments, 94 in patients with Bell''s palsy and 6 with herpes zoster. INTERVENTION:
    Diagnostic. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Evaluation according to the weighted regional
    Sunnybrook system, the gross House-Brackmann system, and the unweighted regional
    Yanagihara system. Weighted kappa statistics was used to measure agreement between
    the grading systems. RESULTS: The average weighted kappa value between the Sunny-brook,
    House-Brackmann, and Yanagihara grading systems was 0.65; kappa values increased
    temporally (but not statistically significantly) up to day 180. The highest agreement
    value, 0.72, was found between the Sunnybrook and Yanagihara grading systems.
    The weighted kappa value between the Sunnybrook and House-Brackmann systems was
    0.59. In Sunnybrook gradings less than 63, there was an overlap between House-Brackmann
    scores of III to VI. Reliable conversion tables between the gross House-Brackmann
    system and the regional Sunnybrook and Yanagihara systems could not be established.
    CONCLUSION: The Sunnybrook system scores at the same agreement level as the House-Brackmann
    and Yanagihara grading systems. There is an evaluative difference between the
    weighted regional Sunnybrook and the gross House-Brackmann systems. Substantial
    agreement was found between the regional Sunnybrook and Yanagihara scales. Sunnybrook
    grading is easy and quick. By adding objective measurements and additional secondary
    defects, the Sunnybrook system can be an alternative to the other predominating
    grading systems.'

    study in which 6 otolaryngologists viewed videotapes of patients with facial nerve
    paralysis. SETTING: University and medical Centers. PATIENTS: Patients with unilateral
    lower motor neurone facial nerve dysfunction greater than 1 year after onset,
    none of whom had undergone surgical reanimation procedures. Intervention Twenty-one
    patients with facial nerve paralysis were videotaped while they performed a protocol
    of facial movements. Six otolaryngologists viewed the videotapes and scored them
    with the Sydney and Sunnybrook systems, and then gave a House Brackmann grade.
    MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The 3 systems of grading facial nerve paralysis were evaluated
    and compared with the use of intraclass correlation coefficients, Pearson''s weighted
    kappa, and percentage exact agreement values. RESULTS: The Sydney and the Sunnybrook
    systems had good intrasystem reliability and high intersystem association for

    is good correlation between ratings given on the Sydney and Sunnybrook systems,
    and within each system there is good reliability. The assessment of synkinesis
    was far less reliable within, and less related between, systems. Although the
    reliability of the House Brackmann system was found to be high, examination of
    individual grades revealed some wide variation between trained observers.'

  abstract: 'OBJECTIVE: To determine if the diagram with schematic drawings of the
    face based on House-Brackmann facial nerve grading scale can be of easier use
    than the original grading scale for facial palsy patients. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective
    case study of 32 patients with facial palsy. SETTING: Tertiary referral center-university
    hospital. PATIENTS: Patients with different degrees of acute peripheral facial
    palsy from any cause. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The patients were photographed and
    then classified by degree of facial palsy through analysis of the pictures. At
    first, three of the authors individually utilised the original classification
    described by House-Brackmann facial nerve grading and then, after 7 days, they
    employed the illustration table proposed. After 30 days, the same methods were
    again used by the same authors for both House-Brackmann facial nerve grading and
    the illustration table. RESULTS: The analysis of the obtained data reveals that
    the classification described by House and Brackmann (Otolaryngol. Head Neck Surg.
    1985;93:146) presents several items to be evaluated, making it difficult to use
    and demanding greater time for correct application. On the contrary, the proposed
    illustration table allows faster evaluation and easier memorisation, not being
    subject to possible interpretation or translation mistakes, as illustrations are
    a universal language. Neither method presented absolute reproducibility, however,
    we found slightly larger concordance indexes among the authors for the proposed
    illustration table. We noticed average values of reproducibility were approximately
    65% in the House-Brackmann classification, and 75% in the evaluation using the
    diagram of the schematic drawings. CONCLUSIONS: The authors concluded that the
    illustration table could be utilised in substitution for the original description
    of House-Brackmann facial nerve grading; they also concluded that the illustration
    table allows faster evaluation and easier memorisation.'

    Eight video-recorded facial palsy patients were graded in 2 sittings by 28 doctors.
    Repeatability and agreement for SFGS were measured by intraclass correlation coefficient
    (ICC) and coefficient of repeatability (CR), and for H-B FGS by agreement percentage
    and kappa coefficients. RESULTS: Repeatability for SFGS was from good to excellent
    and for H-B FGS from fair to good. Agreement between doctors for SFGS was moderate
    by CR and nearly perfect by ICC. For H-B FGS, the agreement percentage was 50%,

    least as good in repeatability as H-B FGS and showed more reliable results in
    agreement between doctors. SIGNIFICANCE: While waiting for an ideal scale for

  abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Evaluation of the severity of facial paralysis deformity
    and the effectiveness of reconstructive surgery requires a measurement tool that
    is practical and simple enough for daily use. It should be able to objectively
    measure facial asymmetry at rest and the amount of facial movement during expression.
    The authors present and assess a simple measurement technique that is readily
    usable in the clinic. Designed to evaluate smile reconstruction, the technique
    can be used to evaluate other parts of the paralyzed face, such as the eye, nose,
    and forehead. METHODS: A standardized handheld ruler measuring technique is described
    for the assessment of the position and the movement of five points marked on the
    lips. The measured points are used to characterize the position of the mouth at
    rest and the movement that occurs with smiling. The technique uses two transparent
    rulers that are held in the examiner''s hand. Using this technique, two experienced
    examiners separately measured the rest position of 21 unilateral facial paralysis
    patients twice, creating 84 sets of measurements. Accuracy was assessed by simultaneously
    measuring the movement of the commissure and mid upper lip during smiling on 10
    normal persons using both handheld ruler and a proven technique, the facial reanimation
    measurement system. RESULTS: The average intraclass correlation coefficients for
    interrater and intrarater reliability exceed 0.89. The mean difference between
    the handheld ruler and facial reanimation measurement system measurements was
    1.7 mm. CONCLUSION: The handheld ruler technique is simple, reliable, and accurate,
    providing useful measurements for the evaluation of facial paralysis reconstructions.'

  abstract: The search for an internationally acceptable facial grading system has
    resulted in an assessment of existing methods by several investigators. These
    studies were based on observations of video film taken of patients with varying
    degrees of facial malfunction. Although the grading systems were evaluated, the
    use of videotape has never been compared with clinical examination and its suitability
    for this type of work is, therefore, unknown. We used nine facial grading systems
    to compare the results of clinical observation with those of photographic methods
    of presentation. The latter included videotape, photographic slides, and a combination
    of the two. The correlation between clinical examination findings and findings
    of any of the photographic methods was poor, suggesting the need for a standard
    form of presentation when grading patients. The most consistent results were found
    with either clinical examination or photographic slides; videotape was the least
    reliable.

    nerve grading scale in the setting of differential function across its branches.
    STUDY DESIGN: Prospective. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Eleven physicians with different
    levels of clinical experience and three upper-level medical students were provided
    with digital video clips of 11 patients with differential facial nerve functioning,
    and asked to report facial nerve function as a traditional global score and as
    a regional score on the basis of the House-Brackmann scale for the forehead, eye,
    nose, and mouth. Agreements between the traditional global score and the regional
    scores, as well as inter-rater agreement, were analyzed. RESULTS: In patients
    with variable facial weakness, a single House-Brackmann score did not fully communicate
    facial function. The single House-Brackmann score most strongly correlated with
    the regional scoring of the nose/midface (59%), followed by the mouth (51%), eye
    (48%), and forehead (35%). Overall inter-reader reliability was relatively strong
    for the midface (kappa = 0.503) and global scores (kappa = 0.541), followed by
    the mouth (k = 0.419), the forehead (k = 0.330), and the eye (k = 0.302). There
    was a marked tendency for reader agreement to increase among those with more clinical

    scale more fully communicates facial function and increases in reliability with
    experience.'

  abstract: 'OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: In clinical research, which is distinctly quantitative
    and rigidly fixed to a written protocol, the need for precision is great, especially
    when multicenter trials are planned. The Sunnybrook Facial Grading System (SB)
    is a well-established tool for assessing facial movement outcomes; however, some
    ambiguities do arise. The purpose of this study was to construct specific grading
    criteria and to test the intra-rater and inter-rater reliability before and after
    the use of these criteria. The hypothesis was that even in naive observers, specific
    criteria improve reliability. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective test of hypothesis. METHODS:
    Facial video recordings of 30 subjects with facial paralysis were randomly presented
    to two naive raters in four trials; trials 1 and 2 using the SB system in the
    usual manner, and trials 3 and 4 using specific grading criteria for the SB system.
    RESULTS: The SB system was reliable, even with naive raters, having an intraclass
    correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.890 between raters; this was improved with
    the use of specific grading criteria to 0.927. Additionally, variability of the
    SB composite scores was greatest in the midrange of scores and was predominantly
    seen during voluntary movement of brow rising and lip puckering. CONCLUSIONS:
    To our knowledge, this is the first report of specific criteria for completing
    the SB system. It is also the first in-depth description of the location within
    the system in which the majority of variances occur.'

  abstract: 'OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: Subjective scales of facial function were plagued
    with reporting variations until the House-Brackmann scale was described in 1985.
    Despite its utility, weaknesses were identified, including noninclusion of synkinesis
    phenomena and insensitivity to segmental weakness. Therefore, the scale was recently
    revised to address these weaknesses. The objective of this investigation was to
    determine agreement between the original and the updated House-Brackmann scales.
    STUDY DESIGN: Prospective clinical trial. METHODS: Fifty consecutive new facial
    paralysis patients underwent standardized facial videography while performing
    facial movements. Video clips were scored by three independent facial nerve clinicians.
    The time it took to produce a score for each method was tracked. Interobserver
    correlations were calculated, and comparisons were made between scores by using
    the original and modified House-Brackmann scales. RESULTS: : Interobserver correlation
    was high for both House-Brackmann scales. Overall scores were in excellent agreement
    (difference of 0.1 +/- 0.5, no statistical difference), although the modified
    scale took substantially longer to calculate (120 seconds +/- 20 seconds vs. 30
    seconds +/- 10 seconds, P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: We found substantial grading correlation

    facial palsy. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective multicenter trial. SETTING: Seventeen
    otorhinolaryngological centers. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Data are part of the Scandinavian
    Bell''s palsy study. The facial function of 1920 patients with peripheral facial
    palsy was assessed 5397 times with both Sunnybrook and House-Brackmann (H-B) facial
    grading systems. Grading was done at initial visit, at days 11 to 17 of palsy
    onset, and at 1 month, 2 months, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months. Statistical
    evaluation was by Spearman correlation coefficient and box plot analysis. RESULTS:
    Spearman correlation coefficient varied from -0.81 to -0.96, with the weakest
    correlation found at initial visit. Box plot analysis for all assessments revealed
    that Sunnybrook scores were widely spread over different H-B grades. With 50%
    of the results closest to the median, Sunnybrook composite scores varied in H-B
    grades as follows: H-B I, 100; H-B II, 71 to 90; H-B III, 43 to 62; H-B IV, 26

    in follow-up assessments than at initial visit. As shown by the wide overlap of
    the grading results, subjective grading systems are only approximate. However,
    a conversion table for Sunnybrook and H-B gradings was obtained and is included
    in the article. It can be used for further development of facial grading systems.'

    The outcome dysfunction after facial paralysis is commonly evaluated by subjective

    with facial paralysis more than 6 months after onset were studied for outcomes
    in terms of synkinesis, contracture, and lip deviation to the healthy side. Abnormalities
    were read with a simple measuring box. RESULTS: Among the controls, mean lip shift
    at rest and its SD were 0 degrees  and 1.2. Mean eye narrowing at maximum lip
    protrusion effort and its SD were -0.6 mm and 1.6. This paper proposes a new grading

  abstract: The Sunnybrook Facial Grading System (SFGS) is one of the most employed
    scales to assess the severity of facial palsy. The aim of our study was to produce
    an Italian version of the SFGS and of its explanatory criteria, and to test their
    measurement properties when employed by Italian physicians. A multidisciplinary
    committee translated and adapted the scale and its criteria into Italian. Six
    native Italian physicians, four of whom experienced in facial palsy and two novices,
    rated independently 29 videos of facial palsy patients twice. Internal consistency,
    agreement and repeatability were evaluated. The Italian version of the SFGS showed
    a high degree of internal consistency with a Cronbach's alpha of 0.91. The test-retest
    reliability was high for both inter-rater and intra-rater measures with an ICC
    of 0.96 and 0.98, respectively. The scores given by the novice physicians were
    comparable with the scores given by the expert physicians. Our study suggests
    that the Italian version of the SFGS has excellent internal consistency and reproducibility,
    comparable to the original scale. Our study confirms in an independent case record
    the high measurement properties of SFGS and provides the first validated Italian
    scale for the assessment of facial palsy.

  abstract: 'OBJECTIVES: Several modalities currently exist to rate the degree of
    facial function clinically but even though it has significant limitations, the
    most widely used scale is the House-Brackmann grading system (HBGS). A simplified
    scale is introduced here, the ''Rough'' Grading System (RGS - Grade I: normal
    movement; Grade II: slight paralysis; Grade III: frank paralysis with eye closure;
    Grade IV: frank paralysis without eye closure; Grade V: almost complete paralysis
    with only slight movements; Grade VI: total paralysis). The aim of the present
    study was to verify the interrater reliability and the interscale validity of
    this simplified grading system. STUDY DESIGN: Scale validation study based on
    a prospective cohort. METHODS: Fifty patients with facial palsy, consecutively
    referred to our department were filmed while performing some codified facial movements.
    Then two independent groups (one rating using the HBGS, the other rating using
    the RGS) assigned a grade after reviewing the videos. The time required for the
    rating was also noted. RESULTS: The HBGS showed a mean value of interrater agreement
    of 0.46 while the RGS showed a mean value of 0.59. The concurrent validity between
    HBGS and RGS ranged from 0.86 to 0.90 (p < 0.001 for every comparison). There
    was no statistically significant difference between HBGS and RGS in the mean time
    taken for rating (p = 0.15). CONCLUSIONS: The RGS reached an adequate level of
    interrater reliability, higher than the HBGS. The correlation between the two
    scales is high and the times required for rating are similar. The present results
    may justify the use of the RGS in routine clinical practice. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE:

  abstract: Many systems for reporting results of facial function tests have been
    proposed, but after five International Facial Nerve Symposia, a perfect system
    for reporting has yet to be developed. In 1985 the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head
    and Neck Surgery adopted the House-Brackmann (H-B) six-point subjective grading
    scale as a universal standard. This decision was based on the recommendation of
    the Facial Nerve Disorders Committee. The next year, 1986, Burres and Fisch proposed
    the Linear Measurement Index (B-F LMI) as an alternative, objective grading system.
    To determine the ability of each system to grade the facial function of patients
    with facial palsy, and the relative merits of each system, 41 patients with facial
    weakness and one normal patient were studied. The H-B grading system is easy to
    use and provides simple, concise criteria for each separate grade of facial function.
    The B-F LMI grading system is time-consuming and labor-intensive, and requires
    a complex calculation to derive a percentage value that represents facial function.
    The most important finding of this study was the high degree of correlation between
    the two systems, in spite of the fact that the H-B system is subjective and qualitative
    while the B-F LMI system is objective and quantitative. Until the perfect grading
    system is developed, the authors favor combining the H-B and B-F LMI systems as
    the best method available at the moment to evaluate facial function.

    assessment and FNGS 2.0 for the mouth, eyes, and brow were 72%, 63%, and 52%,
    respectively. CONCLUSION: FNGS 2.0 shows moderate agreement with HB grading. Regional
    assessment, rather than HB grading, yields stricter evaluation, resulting in better
    prognosis and determination of grade.'

  abstract: The House and Brackmann grading system has been recommended as a universal
    standard for assessing the degree of facial palsy. This study examined the inter-observer
    reliability of this system. Three observers assigned a grade to each patient,
    examined independently, on the same day. Forty patients with a unilateral facial
    palsy of varying aetiology and severity were assessed. Of the 120 judgements,
    eight were in dispute, by a maximum of one grade, giving an inter-observer reliability
    of 93 per cent. We conclude that the House and Brackmann grading system is a simple
    and robust method of assessing facial function.

    systems, we compared the results obtained with the Fisch, House, and Linear Measurement
    grading techniques in 12 subjects exhibiting varying degrees of palsy. Although
    most grading systems correlate well with each other, systems can vary dramatically
    in patient discrimination, interobserver variability, relative underrating and

    Objective and subjective data offer selective advantages.

  abstract: 'A comprehensive, accurate, and valid system for reporting results of
    facial nerve surgery and disease is needed. This study describes and statistically
    analyzes eight currently available systems for reliability, validity, and ease
    of use. They are divided into three grading categories: gross scales, regional
    systems, and specific scales. Botman and Jongkees, May, and Peitersen have proposed
    five-point gross scales. Janssen, Smith, Adour and Swanson, and Yanagihara have
    devised regional systems. Stennert has proposed a specific criteria scale. Fifteen
    otologists experienced with facial nerve problems used modifications of the existing
    scales to evaluate videotapes of 12 patients representing the complete range of
    facial function. The observers'' responses were translated back to the original
    scales. Observers also ranked patients from least to most severe, to obtain an
    accurate assessment of facial function for patients in the study. A follow-up
    questionnaire examined observers'' system preferences. Validity is measured by
    correlating responses to different scales and by comparing responses to each scale
    with observers'' rankings. All scales have good validity except the scales of
    Stennert and Yanagihara. Consistency of responses is determined by reliability
    coefficients. Coefficients for all scales are high except for the gross scale,
    which is moderately reliable, and the Stennert scale, which is unreliable. Results
    indicate that all scales succeed in evaluating patients with normal function or
    total paralysis. The regional scales have the highest reliabilities but they also
    have wide response ranges. Most also assume a level of precision that is unsubstantiated.
    Gross scales have smaller ranges, which result in greater agreement of responses
    but lower reliability. Comparisons to more complex scales show that the simpler
    gross scales convey similar information about patients. The study concludes that
    a gross scale is the best type of system and proposes a new scale for international
    acceptance. This system has six categories, includes secondary defects, is designed
    to clearly differentiate between moderate degrees of dysfunction, and should facilitate
    interpretation and communication of facial nerve results.'

  abstract: Lack of uniformity in reporting facial nerve recovery in patients with
    facial nerve paralysis has been a major disadvantage in comparing treatment modalities.
    To remove subjectivity from the analysis, we devised a facial paralysis recovery
    profile as a system for measuring facial motion. This profile has been used since
    1968 at Kaiser Permanente Medical Center, Oakland, California. The House facial
    paralysis grading system was introduced in 1983 for clinical use and was modified
    by Brackmann in 1985. This latter system has since been accepted by the American
    Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery in the United States as the standard
    used in reporting results. In a prospective study of 54 patients, we tested multiple
    parameters that affect accurate reporting. We tested reliability and accuracy
    of facial measurements by using 30 control subjects and 3 independent examiners.
    We used Pearson correlation coefficients to statistically analyze results. To
    compare our system with the House-Brackmann grading system, we measured facial
    motions of 24 patients randomly selected from our data bank. All had incomplete
    returns of facial function and facial defects associated with faulty regeneration
    of a partially denervated facial nerve. Our overall results show defects in the
    House-Brackmann system which should be addressed. We offer the Adour-Swanson grading
    system as a reliable, easy-to-use, suitable alternative to the House-Brackmann
    system.

  abstract: The House-Brackmann is the most widely accepted system for the clinical
    assessment of facial nerve function. It is, however, being subjective and discontinuous,
    prone to interobserver variation. The need for an objective system persists. The
    Nottingham System is described and compared to the Burres-Fisch system in a study
    of 29 subjects with varying degrees of facial nerve function, ranging from normal
    to total paralysis. Within-group component of variance analysis was 7% for the
    Nottingham System compared to 26% for the Burres-Fisch system. Bland and Altmans'
    analysis showed the Burres-Fisch system to be biased, overestimating small percentage
    scores, and underestimating large ones. The Nottingham System proved unbiased.
    The Nottingham System is recommended as an accurate objective continuous grading
    system for the rapid assessment of facial nerve function in the clinic.

  abstract: Clinicians require a reliable and valid method of evaluating facial function
    after facial nerve injury. This tool should be clinically relevant and easy to
    administer, provide a quantitative score for reporting purposes, and be sensitive
    enough to detect clinically important change over time or with treatment. The
    proposed facial grading system has all essential information, including precise
    definitions for each item, presented on one page. The facial grading system is
    based on the evaluation of resting symmetry, degree of voluntary excursion of
    facial muscles, and degree of synkinesis associated with specified voluntary movement.
    Different regions of the face are examined separately with the use of five standard
    expressions. All items are evaluated on point scales, and a cumulative composite
    score is tabulated. Construct validity was addressed by comparing the proposed
    facial grading system to prerehabilitation and postrehabilitation treatment scores
    of 19 patients with varying degrees of facial nerve injury. All patients had documented
    change in a controlled study of feedback training. The proposed system reports
    results in a more continuous manner with a wider response range than the House-Brackmann
    grades. Each component of the grading system is sensitive to change and individually
    contributes to a change in the composite score. Tests of interrater reliability
    are currently near completion.

  abstract: The Fisch Detailed Evaluation of Facial Symmetry (DEFS) and House-Brackmann
    grading system (HBGS) were compared by statistical examination for their reliability
    and interobserver variability. Furthermore, the correlation and agreement with
    a standard global evaluation were compared. Therefore 47 patients with facial
    palsy of different cause have been evaluated with the two systems, and the global
    overall evaluation was done by five otolaryngologists familiar with facial palsy.
    The DEFS showed a high reliability of 0.93 compared with a reliability of 0.77
    with the HBGS (international standard requires a reliability of at least 0.8).
    The mean interobserver variability is 5.24% (SD = 3.2%) with the DEFS and 9.26%
    (SD = 5.0%) with the HBGS; with a confidence interval of 95%, it is 11.6% and
    19.26%. The correlation of both gradings with the global evaluation was high,
    with r = 0.98 and r = 0.97. The DEFS shows an excellent agreement with the global
    overall evaluation in 41 (87%) of 47 cases and the HBGS in 32 (66%) of 47 cases.
