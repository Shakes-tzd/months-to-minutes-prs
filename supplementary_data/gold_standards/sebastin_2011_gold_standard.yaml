  abstract: The authors describe the functional and aesthetic results of microsurgical
    replantation of 21 fingertip amputations at or distal to the nail base-namely,
    zone I amputations. There were 15 male and 6 female patients, with an average
    age of 26 years (age range, 1-41 years). Replantations were performed using the
    anastomosis of the artery-only technique, with neither vein nor nerve repair.
    Venous drainage was provided by an external bleeding method with a fish-mouth
    incision in "distal" zone I amputations for approximately 7 days, and by the use
    of leeches in more "proximal" zone I amputations for 10 to 12 days. Results indicated
    that the overall survival rate was 76%, with 16 of 21 digits surviving. Sensory
    evaluation at an average follow-up of 12 months (range, 6-18 months) revealed
    an average static two-point discrimination of 6.1 mm (range, 2.0-8.0 mm). Considering
    the unfavorable results and the donor site morbidity of various fingertip reconstructions,
    a microsurgical fingertip replantation should always be considered except in extremely
    distal, clean-cut, pediatric cases, in which case a composite graft is a possibility.
    The results of this series indicate that an amputated fingertip in zone I can
    be salvaged successfully by microvascular anastomosis of the artery only, with
    a nonmicrosurgical method of venous drainage. Furthermore, acceptable sensory
    recovery can be expected without any nerve coaptation.

  abstract: Adequate venous outflow is the most important factor for successful fingertip
    replantation. The authors have attempted venous anastomosis in all cases of fingertip
    replantation to overcome postoperative congestion. In this article, the significance
    of venous repair for fingertip replantation is described from the authors' results
    of 64 complete fingertip amputations in 55 consecutive patients, which were replanted
    from January of 1996 to June of 2001. The overall survival rate was 86 percent.
    Of the 44 replantations in zone I, 37 survived, and the success rate was 84 percent.
    Of the 20 replantations in zone II, 18 survived, and the success rate was 90 percent.
    Venous anastomosis was attempted in all cases, but it was possible in 39 zone
    I and in all zone II replantations. For arterial repair, vein grafts were necessary
    in 17 of the 44 zone I and in one of the 20 zone II replantations; for venous
    repair, they were necessary in six zone I replantations and one zone II replantation.
    Postoperative vascular complications occurred in 15 replantations. There were
    five cases of arterial thrombosis and 10 cases of venous congestion. Venous congestion
    occurred in nine zone I and one zone II replantations. In five of these 10 replantations,
    venous anastomosis was not possible. In another five replantations, venous outflow
    was established at the time of surgery, but occlusion occurred subsequently. Except
    for the five failures resulting from arterial thrombosis, successful venous repair
    was possible in 49 of 59 replantations (83 percent). Despite the demand for skillful
    microsurgical technique and longer operation time, the authors' results using
    venous anastomosis in successful fingertip replantations are encouraging. By performing
    venous anastomosis, external bleeding can be avoided and a higher survival rate
    can be achieved. Venous anastomosis for fingertip replantation is a reliable and
    worthwhile procedure.

  abstract: Restoration of finger length and function are the goals of replantation
    after fingertip amputation. Methods include microsurgical replantation and nonmicrosurgical
    replantation, such as composite graft techniques. To increase the survival rates
    for composite grafts, the subcutaneous pocket procedure has been used as a salvage
    procedure. The subdermal pocket procedure, which is a modification of the subcutaneous
    pocket procedure, was used for replantation of 17 fingertips in 16 consecutive
    patients. Eight fingertips experienced guillotine injuries and the other nine
    fingertips experienced crush injuries. Revascularization of one digital artery
    without available venous outflow was performed for six fingers, and composite
    graft techniques were used for the other 11 fingers. The success rate was 16 of
    17 cases. The difference in success rates for guillotine versus crush injuries
    was statistically significant. Comparison of patients with arterial anastomoses
    and patients without arterial anastomoses also indicated a statistically significant
    difference. Thirteen fingertips survived completely. One finger, demonstrating
    complete loss and early termination of the pocketing procedure, was amputated
    on the eighth postoperative day. Two fingers were partially lost because of severe
    crushing injuries. One finger demonstrated partial loss of more than one quarter
    of the fingertip, which required secondary revision, because the patient was a
    heavy smoker. The pocketing period was 8 +/- 1 days (mean +/- SD, n = 6) for the
    fingers revascularized with one digital arterial anastomosis and 13.3 +/- 1.9
    days (n = 10) for the fingers successfully replanted with composite graft techniques.
    The mean active range of motion of the interphalangeal joint of the three thumbs
    was 65 +/- 5 degrees, and that of the distal interphalangeal joint of the other
    11 fingers was 51 +/- 11 degrees. The static two-point discrimination result was
    6.4 +/- 1.0 mm (n = 14) after an average of 11 +/- 5 months of follow-up monitoring.
    Compared with other methods, the subdermal pocket procedure has the advantages
    of exact subdermal/subdermal contact, a shorter pocketing period, and more feasible
    observation. The method can offer an alternative salvage procedure for fingertip
    amputations with no suitable vessels available for microsurgical replantation.

  abstract: In fingertip amputations, conventional stump plasty provides an almost
    acceptable functional result. However, replanting fingertips can preserve the
    nail and minimize loss of function. We investigated the functional and cosmetic
    results of fingertip replantation at the terminal branch of the digital artery.
    Outcomes were nailbed width and distal-segment length; sensory recovery; and range
    of motion (ROM) of thumb-interphalangeal (IP) or finger-distal interphalangeal
    (DIP) joints, and total active motion (TAM) of the replanted finger. Of 15 fingertips
    replanted after only arterial anastomosis, 13 were successful, and 12 were studied.
    After a median of 1.3 years, mean nailbed widths and distal-segment lengths were
    95.4% and 93.0%, respectively, of the contralateral finger. Average TAM and ROM
    of the thumb-IP or finger-DIP joints were 92.0% and 83.0% of normal, respectively.
    Semmes-Weinstein results were blue (3.22 to 3.61) in 4 fingers and purple (3.84
    to 4.31) in 8; the mean result from the 2-point discrimination test was 5.9 mm
    (range, 3 to 11 mm). Thus, amputated fingertips should be aggressively replanted.

  abstract: Microvascular replantation at the distal phalangeal level has recently
    been reported by several authors, but as yet the rate of success has not been
    constant owing to the technical difficulties associated with small vessels. To
    solve this problem, over the last 4 years we have used arteriovenous anastomosis
    to reestablish either the arterial system or the venous drainage system in the
    33 digits of our 23 patients. The results have been excellent, with a 91 percent
    success rate. Such results for replantation of the distal phalanx may be maintained
    and improved if a small venous graft with several branches is also utilized.

  abstract: The authors describe, in the first report of this type of replantation
    surgery, a high success rate using delayed venous anastomosis in 16 consecutive
    distal phalangeal replantations under digital block. Among these replantations,
    seven fingers (43.8 percent) showed postoperative venous congestion and five fingers
    were reoperated on with delayed venous drainage under digital block. All the reoperated
    fingers were successfully drained by additional single or double venous drainage
    with a vein graft. As a result, 13 fingers survived (81.3 percent success rate).
    All operations were performed under a digital block.

  abstract: Ninety-five patients with 98 complete or incomplete amputations of digits
    are reviewed. Three levels are considered according to the bony lesion, zone III
    being distal to the nail matrix. In this area, artery, nerve and vein repair need
    special techniques. The use of leeches in the absence of vein repair does not
    preclude an acceptable survival rate (68%), compared to the overall series (65.5%);
    however, smoking is detrimental (52%). Distal replantation is a fast and worthwhile
    procedure providing acceptable sensibility, no PIP limitation and good appearance
    at the price of a mean 74 days off work.

  abstract: The sensory recovery outcomes of fingertip replantations without nerve
    repair were retrospectively studied. Between 2000 and 2006, 112 fingertip replantations
    with only arterial repair were carried out in 98 patients. About 76 of the replants
    survived totally, with a success rate of 67.8%. Evaluation of sensory recovery
    was possible in 31 patients (38 replantations). Sensory evaluation was made with
    Semmes-Weinstein, static and dynamic two-point discrimination, and vibration sense
    tests. Fingertip atrophy, nail deformities, and return to work were also evaluated.
    According to the Semmes-Weinstein test, 29.0% (11/38) of the fingers had normal
    sense, 60.5% (23/38) had diminished light touch, 7.9% (3/38) had diminished protective
    sensation, and 2.6% (1/38) had loss of protective sensation. Mean static and dynamic
    two-point discriminations were 7.2 mm (3-11 mm), and 4.60 mm (3-6 mm), respectively.
    Vibratory testing revealed increased vibration in 42.1% of the fingers, decreased
    vibration in 36.8%, and equal vibration when compared with the non-injured fingers
    in 21.1%. Atrophy was present in 14 (36.8%) fingers and negatively affected the
    results. Nail deformities, cold intolerance, return to work, and the effect of
    sensory education were investigated. Comparison of crush and clean cut injuries
    did not yield any significant difference in any of the parameters. Patients who
    received sensory education had significantly better results in sensory testing.
    The results were classified as excellent, good, and poor based on results of two-point
    discrimination tests. The outcome was excellent in 18 fingers and good in 20 fingers.
    Overall, satisfactory sensory recovery was achieved in fingertip replantations
    without nerve repair.

  abstract: 'BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to determine the risk factors
    for an unsuccessful replanted fingertip. METHODS: Two hundred eleven complete
    fingertip amputations in 211 patients who underwent replantation surgery between
    August of 1990 and March of 2006 were included in this study. The patients'' age,
    gender, smoking history, digit position, dominant hand, amputation level, injury
    mechanism, platelet count, ischemia time, preservation method of the amputated
    part, anesthesia, number of arteries repaired, venous drainage, use of vein grafting,
    neurorrhaphy, bone shortening, and smoking after operation were tested for their
    impact on fingertip survival. RESULTS: One hundred seventy-two of 211 patients
    (81.5 percent) had a successful replantation. Univariate analysis showed crush
    or avulsion injury, high platelet count, and inappropriate preservation of the
    amputated part in saline solution or ethanol to be associated with a high incidence
    of replantation failure. Twenty-two of 54 patients (41 percent) who had a crush
    or avulsion trauma had failed replantation. Logistic regression analysis identified
    injury mechanism, platelet count, smoking after operation, preservation method
    of the amputated part, and the use of vein grafting as statistically significant
    predictive factors for success or failure. CONCLUSIONS: Injury mechanism, platelet
    count, smoking after operation, preservation method of amputated part, and the
    use of vein grafting were found to be the main predictors for the survival of
    the replanted fingertip. Applying external bleeding in zone 1 and venous drainage
    through the medullary cavity in zone 2 or venous anastomosis combined with vein
    grafting rather than venous anastomosis alone were strongly recommended in the
    fingertip replantation of crush or avulsion injury.'

  abstract: 'PURPOSE: In fingertip replantation, adequate venous drainage is important
    for success. As the level of amputation becomes more distal, anastomosis of veins
    becomes more technically difficult. External bleeding is a common solution to
    venous congestion, but the process is burdensome because of duration of bleeding
    for 3 or more days after surgery. We present a new technique for reconstructing
    circulation without vein anastomosis in zone I replantation and analyze the outcomes
    of this technique in terms of eliminating external bleeding and of a high survival
    rate of the replanted digits. METHODS: Between 1997 and 2007, we performed 120
    replantations in 112 patients (83 male and 29 female; mean age, 33 years; range,
    3-54 years). All were zone I amputations, based on the Tamai classification. We
    surgically repaired both proper digital arteries, excluded the vein, and then
    ligated 1 of the arteries. Using this technique, circulation was restored. Included
    in the outcome evaluation were 91 digits in the 87 patients (mean age, 35 years;
    range, 14-54) who returned for outcome assessments 12 months after surgery. RESULTS:
    Of 120 digits replanted, 115 digits survived, corresponding to an overall success
    rate of 96%. No patients received alternative means to alleviate venous congestion,
    such as leeches or other means of external bleeding. Nearly all of the 87 patients
    (91 digits) were satisfied with the results of the replantations. CONCLUSIONS:
    Our technique reconstructs circulation without vein anastomosis in zone I replantation.
    This alternative to venous congestion involves a simple surgical procedure and
    straightforward postoperative care. Follow-up assessments of a series of 120 replantations
    show that the majority of zone I replantations led to satisfactory function. We
    therefore propose this technique as an effective method for zone I replantation.

  abstract: In this retrospective study, the survival rates of fingertip replantation
    with and without vein grafting were evaluated along with their postoperative functional
    and cosmetic results. One hundred twenty-one-fingertip amputations were performed
    in 103 patients between September 2002 and July 2007. Thirty-four amputated fingertips
    were replanted without vein grafting, while 87 amputated fingertips were replanted
    with vein grafting for arterial and/or venous repairs. The overall survival rates
    of the replantations with and without vein grafting were 90% (78/87) and 85% (29/34),
    respectively. The survival rates were 88% (36/41) with venous repair, 93% (25/27)
    with arterial repair, and 89% (17/19) with both. Nineteen patients without vein
    grafting and 48 patients with vein grafting had a follow-up period of more than
    one year. Good cosmetic and functional outcomes were observed in both groups of
    patients. The results show that vein grafting is a reliable technique in fingertip
    replantations, showing no significant difference (P > 0.05) in survival between
    those with and without vein grafting. Furthermore, no significant difference (P
    > 0.05) in survival was found between cases with vein grafts for arterial and/or
    venous repairs. In fingertip replantations with vein grafting, favorable functional
    and esthetic results can be achieved without sacrificing replantation survival.

    phalanx was 78%. Replanted digits that underwent venous anastomosis showed a very
    high survival rate of 93%. Loss of the distal interphalangeal joint function in
    subzone IV was significantly inferior to that in subzones II and III. Protective
    sensation was achieved in 96% of replanted digits. Sensory recovery in the absence
    of nerve repair was significantly worse for avulsion injury than for crush injury.
    Nail deformity tended to be increased for replanted digits in subzone III or with
    crush-type injury. Successful venous anastomosis appears to offer the best way
    to promote survival of replanted digits. If venous anastomosis is infeasible,
    a replanted digit can survive with any methods for venous drainage in subzones
    II and III, but does not survive in subzone IV. To minimise nail deformity, repair
    of the germinal matrix is necessary.

  abstract: Although success of digital replantations in children has been reported
    by many authors, the very distal fingertip replantation remains technically demanding.
    The aim of this article is to review our experience with fingertip replantations
    at or distal to the nail base in pediatric patients and evaluate the clinical
    outcomes. From October 2000 to May 2007, 12 pediatric fingertips amputated at
    or distal to the nail base were replanted. Only one artery was anastomosed for
    revascularization with or without nerve repair; vein drainage was provided by
    the controlled bleeding technique. Eleven of the 12 replants (91%) survived; one
    replant of crushed digit failed. An average of 26 month (range, 6 to 36 months)
    follow-up revealed excellent restoration of finger motion and appearance. The
    regained static 2-point discrimination (S2PD) sensation was from 3.2 to 5.0 mm
    (mean, 4.2 mm). Both the parents and the children were satisfied with the final
    results. In conclusion, fingertip replantation in children allows good functional
    and esthetical recovery and should be attempted if technically feasible.

  abstract: 'BACKGROUND: We have previously reported the importance of adequate and
    precise arterial anastomosis and the hypothesis that, up to subzone III, fingertip
    amputation salvage can be achieved on arterial anastomosis alone. These findings
    were reported during the meeting of the Japanese Society of Reconstructive Microsurgery.
    This is our follow-up report with insight and opinion on the limitations of complete
    fingertip amputation salvage on arterial anastomosis alone. METHODS: We examined
    67 fingers (59 patients) with fingertip amputations presenting to our hospital
    between January 2005 and December 2008. Amputation levels and whether these injuries
    received only arterial or both arterial and venous anastomoses were noted. Fisher
    exact test was used to examine statistical differences between the groups. RESULTS:
    Amputation levels were 11 in subzone I, 20 in subzone II, 17 in subzone III, and
    19 in subzone IV. Successful replantation was achieved in 87% (58 of 67) of fingers.
    There was no statistically significant difference between fingers receiving arterial
    alone versus both anastomoses in amputations of subzones I, II, and III. CONCLUSIONS:
    We found that with proper postoperative congestion care, no statistically significant
    difference in replantation success of fingers receiving arterial anastomosis alone
    versus both arterial and venous were noted up to subzone III. However, in subzone
    IV, regardless of the postoperative congestion, compete necrosis rates are high;
    thus, it is speculated that a venous anastomosis is necessary for successful replantation.
    It is preferable to perform as many anastomoses as possible, but we believe that
    it is also desirable for the procedure to be fast and less invasive. In cases
    that have no adequate vein, fingertip replantation can be achieved on arterial
    anastomosis alone up to subzone III.'

  abstract: 'PURPOSE: Artery-only fingertip replantation can be reliable if low-resistance
    flow through the replant is maintained until venous outflow is restored naturally.
    Injuring the tip of the replant to promote ongoing bleeding augmented with anticoagulation
    usually accomplishes this; however, such management results in prolonged hospitalization.
    In this study, we analyzed the outcomes of artery-only fingertip replantation
    using a standardized postoperative protocol consisting of dextran-40, heparin,
    and leech therapy. METHODS: Between 2001 and 2008, we performed 19 artery-only
    fingertip replants for 17 patients. All patients had the replanted nail plate
    removed and received intravenous dextran-40, heparin, and aspirin to promote fingertip
    bleeding and vascular outflow. Anticoagulation was titrated to promote a controlled
    bleed until physiologic venous outflow was restored by neovascularization. We
    used medicinal leeches and mechanical heparin scrubbing for acute decongestion.
    By postoperative day 6, bleeding was no longer promoted. We initiated fluorescent
    dye perfusion studies to assess circulatory competence and direct further anticoagulant
    intervention if necessary. The absence of bleeding associated with an initial
    rise followed by an appropriate fall in fluorescent dye concentration would trigger
    a weaning of anticoagulation. RESULTS: All of the 19 replants survived. The average
    length of hospital stay was 9 days (range, 7-17 d). Eleven patients received blood
    transfusions. The average transfusion was 1.8 units (range, 0-9 units). All patients
    were happy with the decision to replant, and the cosmetic result. CONCLUSIONS:
    A protocol that promotes temporary, controlled bleeding from the fingertip is
    protective of artery-only replants distal to the distal interphalangeal joint
    until physiologic venous outflow is restored. The protocol described is both safe
    and reliable. The patient should be informed that such replant attempts may result
    in the need for transfusions and extended hospital stays, factors that can help
    the physician and patient decide whether to proceed with replantation. TYPE OF
    STUDY/LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic IV.'

  abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Replantation of the distal phalanx and pulp can be performed
    to improve finger function and finger aesthetics; however, establishing adequate
    venous drainage is a challenge. Slattery et al. reported microsurgical reattachment
    of a partial distal phalanx with the use of a bifurcated terminal digital artery.
    The bifurcation was divided into two pedicles, one of which was used for venous
    drainage. In this article, the authors report their experience with a similar
    technique and propose a new algorithm for distal finger replantation. METHODS:
    From January of 2008 to February of 2009, five replantations were performed using
    a single central artery. The replanted levels were pulp, avulsed fingertip of
    the thumb, and distal phalanges. There was no volar vein, dorsal vein, or second
    artery available in the amputated part for standard venous drainage. Venous drainage
    in all cases was established by creating an anastomosis from a branch of the solitary
    terminal artery to a recipient vein. RESULTS: All digits were replanted successfully
    without evidence of arterial insufficiency or venous congestion. Partial necrosis
    was not identified postoperatively in any of the five fingers. There were no cases
    of wound infection. CONCLUSIONS: A branch of the central solitary artery may be
    used successfully to reestablish venous outflow in cases of distal finger tip
    replantation. This technique allowed for the salvage of all fingers in this study
    without the use of leeches or other techniques used in cases of venous insufficiency.'

  abstract: Forty-two complete, single digit amputations at the level of the distal
    interphalangeal joint or distal phalanx are reviewed. Viability was 81%. Operative
    time averaged 4.6 hours. Average age of patients was 28 years and 90% were male.
    Forty-eight percent of the amputations involved the thumb; 79% were at the distal
    interphalangeal joint and 21% were more distal. One artery was repaired in 64%
    of replantations, two or three veins were repaired in 61%, and veins grafts were
    used in 19% of cases. Sixty-nine percent of the crush-avulsion injuries succeeded
    compared with 89% of lacerations. Two-point discrimination averaged 10 mm and
    proximal interphalangeal motion averaged 91 degrees. Patients returned to work
    an average of 2.5 months after replantation and none required additional procedures.
    The average total cost of treatment was $7500.00. Compared with conventional procedures,
    disadvantages of replantation at or distal to the distal interphalangeal joint
    are that it does require microsurgical training, initial operating time is longer,
    and it is more expensive. Advantages are that it is a one-stage procedure that
    gives good distal soft tissue coverage, adequate sensibility without painful neuroma,
    good metacarpophalangeal and proximal interphalangeal joint motion; it preserves
    the nail, maintains digit length, is cosmetically pleasing, and the patient is
    satisfied.

  abstract: Microvascular replantations of digits distal to the distal interphalangeal
    (DIP) joint were reviewed in 33 digits of 29 patients. Twenty-five digits were
    completely amputated and eight were incompletely amputated. Ten of 33 replants
    failed and 23 digits survived. Even without venous reconstruction, good results
    were obtained in Zone I. Of eight completely amputated digits in Zone 1 in which
    venous reconstruction was not performed, seven digits survived. Of four completely
    amputated digits in Zone 2 without venous reconstruction, all became necrotic.
    In digits followed for six months or more after surgery, 11 of 13 replantations
    showed good functional recovery. Two digits that developed paresthesia after replantation
    were functionally useless. Seven digits without bilateral digital nerve reconstruction
    were reviewed six months or more after surgery. Sensory recovery was good in the
    digital phalanx; the factor impeding functional recovery was the development of
    paresthesia. Replanted digits distal to the DIP joint are thus satisfactory in
    both function and cosmesis, even if digital nerves have not been reconstructed.
    The replantation of such digits should be considered.

    of topical heparin to the exposed nail bed were used to provide and maintain venous
    drainage for 14 digital replantations in which an arterial repair but no venous
    repair was done ("artery only" replantation). In each case venous repair was not
    possible since no vein of an acceptable size could be found either because of
    a distal amputation level or because an avulsive or crushing injury had damaged
    the veins in the amputated part. The average operating time per "artery only"
    replantation was 2 1/2 hours. Ten of the 14 "artery only" replantations survived
    (71.4%). The active range of motion, sensibility, strength, activities of daily
    living, and hospitalization for this group of patients were comparable with replantations
    in which both arterial and venous anastomoses were done.

  abstract: Since 1985 we have been performing replantation of amputated fingertips
    using a pre-osteosynthesis vein graft technique. First, we locate an artery and
    vein at the distal part of the fingertip and perform a vein graft. After this,
    we perform osteosynthesis. Since there is sufficient vessel length, the anastomosis
    technique becomes easier than with the method previously used. In our department,
    between 1985 and 1990 we performed 11 Zone I replantations. Ten fingers survived
    and one failed. There were good results in seven cases and three had fair results.
    The pre-osteosynthesis vein graft technique is a reliable technique for amputated
    fingertip replantation.

    an adequate size vein was not found, and the drainage was accomplished with provoked
    bleeding which was maintained for the 3 postoperative days at the expense of blood
    transfusion. In all successful cases the patients returned to their occupation
    in a mean of 9 weeks with very good or excellent functional results.

    amputations at or distal to the distal interphalangeal joint (zone I for amputations
    distal to the nail base of zone II for amputations between the distal interphalangeal
    joint and the nail base) were replanted using a microsurgical technique at Korea
    University Guro Hospital. Because of the high social value placed on body form
    and function, the indication for replantation was extended to cases with severe
    soft-tissue injuries and attempted replantation as a routine procedure in nearly
    all distal amputation cases. The overall survival rate was 78 percent, with the
    survival rate for zone I being 70 percent and that for zone II reaching 86 percent.
    Even in cases with severe soft-tissue injury, the survival rate was high, with
    viability in avulsion injuries and crush injuries reaching 75 percent each. The
    most common type of vascular repair in zone I cases was revascularization of one
    artery only and no vein repair (87 percent). Of these cases, interpositional vein
    grafts were used in 65 percent. In zone II cases, the most common combination
    repair was one artery and one vein anastomosis (70 percent), with interpositional
    vein grafts for arterial anastomosis in 49 percent; most of the venous repair
    was feasible by the direct method (78 percent). The follow-up period ranged from

    more than 6 months. In 52 long-term follow-up patients, the average two-point

    was high (91 percent).

  abstract: In this study, a new classification of fingertip amputation based on the
    surgical treatment is reported. Specifically, the necessity for special procedures
    to prevent venous congestion in fingertip replantation at the nail bed level was
    studied. There are some reports of successful replantations without venous anastomoses.
    In order to avoid technical factors, clinical cases operated on by a single surgeon
    were evaluated to determine what treatment is necessary for amputations at various
    levels to avoid necrosis due to venous congestion. During the 5-year period from
    October 1987 to October 1992, 150 replantations in 137 patients were performed,
    including 49 fingertip replantations in 45 patients who were operated on consecutively
    by a single surgeon. The distal phalanx (DP) of the finger was classified as zone
    DP-I, IIA, IIB, and III from distal to proximal. This classification was based
    not only on the amputation level but also on the difference in surgical treatment.
    For amputations of zone DP-I, which extends from the fingertip to the most distal
    dividing point of the digital artery, the amputated fingertip is attached without
    vascular anastomosis and the whole finger is wrapped in aluminium foil and cooled
    in ice water for 3 days. For amputations of zone DP-IIA and IIB, anastomosis of
    the digital artery is performed in the central portion of the palmar region of
    the finger, but Kirschner wire fixation is not performed so as not to disturb
    the venous drainage through the medullary cavity. For amputations of zone DP-IIA,
    special treatment is not necessary for venous congestion, and for those of zone
    DP-IIB partial resection of the nail is done if necessary. For zone DP-II amputations,
    venous anastomosis must be performed for salvage. All patients were operated on
    according to the procedures based on this classification and final survival rate
    was 91.5%.

  abstract: 'Management of very distal finger amputations is still controversial.
    Successful replantation results in an almost normal finger but is not without
    problems, such as technical difficulty, risk of failure and cost. "Reposition-flap"
    repair is a simpler procedure: it consists of distal bone and nail bed "graft-reposition"
    and pulp reconstruction by a flap. We compare ten successful replantations and
    six reposition-flap reconstructions. Replantation has several advantages over
    reposition-flap repair in terms of less finger shortening, longitudinal nail curvature,
    absence of PIP flexion contracture and shorter time off work. The results of reposition-flap
    repair are less satisfactory, but it is nevertheless a useful alternative when
    replantation is impossible or has failed.'

  abstract: Since January 1990, 237 replantations or revascularizations have been
    attempted in 192 patients with distal traumatic amputations of the digits. The
    amputations were complete in 182 digits and incomplete in 55 digits. Sixty-three
    amputations were in zone I and 174 in zone II (Tamai's classification). The overall
    success rate was 91%. Twelve digits failed in zone I and ten in zone II. We conclude
    that zone I and zone II replantation or revascularization is quick and worthwhile,
    providing acceptable sensation, appearance and near-normal function.
