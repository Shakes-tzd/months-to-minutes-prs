criteria:
  inclusion:
    - "Describes, develops, evaluates, or compares FACIAL NERVE grading instruments/scales/systems (NOT scar assessment)"
    
    - "English language"
    
    - "NO sample minimum (N=10 to N=1920 all acceptable). Validation reviews assess psychometric properties, not clinical efficacy."
    
    - "Reports instrument description OR any evaluation data (reliability, validity, comparison). Accept instruments meeting even 1/6 ideal criteria (comprehensive cataloging, not quality filtering)."
    
    - "Technology/computer-based instruments INCLUDED IF study compares or validates against established clinical grading scales. Objective signals: 'compared to House-Brackmann', 'validated against Sunnybrook', 'versus Sydney scale', 'correlation with clinical grading'. Pure technology without clinical comparison excluded."
    
    - "Patient-reported outcomes INCLUDED IF analyzed alongside or compared to clinician-observed grading. Comparative studies qualify."

  exclusion:
    - "Animal-only or simulation-only studies"
    - "Pure review articles without new instrument data"
    - "Completely unrelated topics (not facial nerve assessment)"
    - "Technology-only WITHOUT comparison to clinical scales"
    - "PRO-only WITHOUT comparison to clinician-observed grading"

    VALIDATION REVIEW - COMPREHENSIVE CATALOGING:
    
    1. NO PRIMARY FOCUS REQUIREMENT: Accept any mention
    2. NO SAMPLE MINIMUM: Even N=10 acceptable
    3. MINIMAL VALIDATION OK: Accept 1/6 ideal criteria
    4. 68% MISSING PSYCHOMETRIC DATA: Acceptable
    5. TECHNOLOGY NUANCE: Include IF compared to clinical scales
       - Signals: "compared to", "validated against", "versus [clinical scale]"
    6. PRO NUANCE: Include IF compared to clinician grading
    7. Default to INCLUDE (comprehensive catalog goal)
