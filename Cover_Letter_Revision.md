Dear Editor,

We are pleased to submit our revised manuscript "From Months to Minutes: Evaluating an AI-Driven Approach to Systematic Reviews in Plastic Surgery" for consideration in *Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery*.

## Summary of Significance

This study addresses a critical bottleneck in plastic surgery evidence synthesis: the 40-80 hours of manual screening required per systematic review. We validate an integrated search-screening workflow that achieves **99.2% sensitivity** (99% recall with 100% accuracy on eligible papers) while reducing processing time by **99.7%** and costs by **99.9%** compared to traditional dual-reviewer methods.

## Key Contributions

1. **Human-AI Collaboration Model:** We demonstrate that expert-configured AI screening, where domain specialists provide precise inclusion/exclusion criteria and AI executes these rules at scale, achieves systematic review-grade performance across diverse plastic surgery topics (microsurgery, reconstructive surgery, aesthetic surgery, outcomes research).

2. **Integrated Architecture:** Unlike existing tools that treat search and screening as disconnected phases, our unified pipeline maintains complete audit trails from database query to inclusion decision, enabling reproducible evidence synthesis.

3. **Clinical Accessibility:** The workflow transforms systematic review feasibility for fellowship programs, private practice groups, and resource-limited institutions—any plastic surgeon with systematic review training can leverage this tool to conduct reviews that previously required multi-person teams.

4. **Living Review Capability:** The infrastructure enables monthly update cycles in 5-10 minutes by reusing expert-configured criteria, transforming 5.5-year update cycles into continuous evidence monitoring.

## Response to Reviewers

We have carefully addressed all reviewer comments with substantial revisions including:

- **Enhanced transparency:** Complete prompt examples, detailed methodology for literature search replication, and explicit explanations of all outcome metrics for clinical readers
- **Comparison with existing tools:** New Discussion section contrasting our approach with ASReview, RobotReviewer, and Rayyan
- **Clarified AI role:** Extensive new sections emphasizing that AI assists domain experts rather than replacing them, with evidence that performance depends entirely on expert configuration quality
- **Strengthened reproducibility:** All screening configurations, validation results, and analysis scripts available via GitHub under MIT license

## Statement of Originality

This manuscript presents original research that has not been published previously and is not under consideration elsewhere. All authors have approved the manuscript and agree with its submission to *Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery*.
